# Loans Overview

## Overview

Loans are individual credit agreements representing money lent to borrowers. In Intain Markets, loans are the building blocks of pools - you group multiple loans together to create pools for securitization, whole loan sales, or credit facilities.

## Who Can Use This

- Issuers who upload and manage loans
- Market Makers who review loan data
- Investors who analyze loan characteristics
- Servicers who manage loan administration

## When This Is Used

Use loans when you:
