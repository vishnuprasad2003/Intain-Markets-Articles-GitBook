# Enabled vs Disabled Actions

## Overview

Understanding why actions are enabled or disabled helps you know what you can do and why certain actions aren't available. This guide explains the logic behind enabled and disabled buttons and actions.

## Who Can Use This

- All platform users

## When This Is Used

Understanding enabled vs disabled actions helps when:
- You see disabled buttons and want to know why
- You need to know what actions are available
- You want to understand workflow requirements
- You need to know what to do to enable actions

## Step-by-Step Process

### Why Actions Are Enabled

1. **You Have Permission**
   - Your role allows the action
   - You have access to the item
   - You're assigned to the item
   - Permissions are granted

2. **Status Allows It**
   - Item is in correct status for action
   - Workflow permits this action
   - Status progression allows it
   - Not blocked by current status

3. **Prerequisites Met**
   - Required information is present
   - Previous steps completed
   - Dependencies satisfied
   - All requirements met

### Why Actions Are Disabled

1. **Wrong Status**
   - Item isn't in right status for action
   - Workflow doesn't permit action
   - Status blocks the action
   - Wrong stage in workflow

2. **Missing Information**
   - Required fields not filled
   - Documents not uploaded
   - Information incomplete
   - Prerequisites missing

3. **Waiting for Others**
   - Another party needs to act first
   - Previous step not completed
   - Dependency not satisfied
   - Waiting for action

4. **Already Completed**
   - Action was already taken
   - Cannot repeat action
   - Already in final state
   - Process complete

5. **No Permission**
   - Your role doesn't allow this action
   - You don't have access
   - Not assigned to item
   - Permissions not granted

## Rules & Validations

- Enabled buttons mean you can use them
- Disabled buttons usually show reasons why
- Status controls what actions are available
- Prerequisites must be met before actions enabled
- Permissions determine what you can do

## What Happens Next

After understanding enabled vs disabled actions:
- You know what actions are available to you
- You understand why certain actions are disabled
- You know what needs to happen to enable actions
- You can plan your workflow accordingly
- You can take appropriate actions when available

Understanding enabled vs disabled actions helps you navigate the platform effectively and know what you can do at each stage of your workflow.
