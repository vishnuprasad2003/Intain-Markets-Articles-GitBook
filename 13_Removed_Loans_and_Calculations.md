# Removed Loans and Calculations

## Overview

When loans are removed from pools, they're excluded from pool calculations but remain visible for tracking purposes. Understanding how removed loans affect calculations helps you manage pool metrics accurately.

## Who Can Use This

- Issuers who manage pools
- Market Makers who review pools
- Investors who analyze pool metrics

## When This Is Used

Understanding removed loans and calculations helps when:
- You need to know how removal affects pool metrics
- You want to understand why metrics changed
- You need to track which loans are included in calculations
- You want to manage pool composition effectively

## Step-by-Step Process

### Understanding Removed Loans

1. **What Removed Means**
   - Loan is excluded from pool balance calculations
   - Loan is not counted in loan counts
   - Loan is excluded from weighted averages
   - Loan remains visible in the pool

2. **Impact on Calculations**
   - Total balance decreases by removed loan's balance
   - Loan count decreases
   - Weighted averages recalculate without removed loans
   - All metrics update automatically

3. **Viewing Removed Loans**
   - Removed loans are marked with "Removed" status
   - You can filter to show or hide removed loans
   - You can see why loans were removed
   - You can reinstate removed loans if needed

## Rules & Validations

- Removed loans are excluded from all pool calculations
- Removed loans remain visible in the pool for tracking
- Pool metrics update automatically when loans are removed
- Reinstated loans are included in calculations again
- Metrics reflect only active loans in the pool

## What Happens Next

After removing loans:
- Pool metrics recalculate automatically
- Total balance and loan count decrease
- Weighted averages update to reflect remaining loans
- Removed loans remain visible but don't affect calculations

After reinstating loans:
- Pool metrics recalculate to include reinstated loans
- Total balance and loan count increase
- Weighted averages update to include reinstated loans
- Loans return to active status

Understanding removed loans and calculations helps you manage pool metrics accurately and make informed decisions about loan inclusion and exclusion.
