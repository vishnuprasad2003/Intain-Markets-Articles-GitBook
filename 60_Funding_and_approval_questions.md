## Overview

This guide answers common questions about credit facilities, funding requests, approvals, and the funding process. These FAQs help you understand the funding workflow and know what to expect at each stage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Term Sheet Questions

**Q: How long does term sheet review take?**

A: Review time varies depending on facility agent workload and term sheet complexity. Typically, reviews take a few days. You'll receive notifications when status changes. Check with the facility agent if you have concerns about timing.

**Q: What happens if my term sheet is rejected?**

A: If your term sheet is rejected, it enters a final state. No master commitment is created, and the facility does not proceed. You receive a rejection reason. You can create a new term sheet addressing the issues that led to rejection.

**Q: Do I need to re-sign if changes are requested?**

A: Usually yes. When changes are requested, you typically need to re-sign the term sheet after making changes. The system will indicate if re-signing is required. Complete electronic signature again after making requested modifications.

**Q: Can I edit a term sheet after submitting it?**

A: No, once submitted, you cannot edit term sheets while they're under review. If changes are requested, you can edit and resubmit. Otherwise, you must wait for the facility agent's decision.

**Q: What happens after my term sheet is approved?**

A: When your term sheet is approved, a master commitment is automatically created. The facility agent configures the complete facility structure, then submits it for lender approval. Once lenders approve, the facility becomes active, and you can create funding requests.

### Master Commitment Questions

**Q: Why was a master commitment created automatically?**

A: Master commitments are automatically created when term sheets are approved. The system creates them with information from your approved term sheet, then the facility agent configures the complete facility structure.

**Q: How long does lender approval take?**

A: Lender approval time varies depending on lender workload and facility complexity. Any lender approval activates the facility - you don't need all lenders to approve. You'll be notified when the facility becomes active.

**Q: Can I see which lenders have approved?**

A: Yes, you can typically see lender approval status. Each lender's approval status is tracked individually, showing who has approved and when. This information is visible on the master commitment details page.

**Q: Can I create funding requests before the facility is active?**

A: No, you can only create funding requests against active facilities. Facilities must be approved by at least one lender and in Active status before you can create funding requests.

**Q: What happens if all lenders reject the master commitment?**

A: If all lenders reject (which is rare), the facility does not become active. The facility agent may reconfigure the master commitment and resubmit, or the process may stop. Check with the facility agent about next steps.

### Funding Request Questions

**Q: How much can I request in a funding request?**

A: You can request up to your available borrowing capacity. The system shows available capacity, and you cannot request more than what's available. Available capacity is calculated based on facility rules and current utilization.

**Q: Can I create multiple funding requests?**

A: Yes, you can create multiple funding requests as long as you don't exceed total facility limits. Each request goes through the review process individually. You can have only one draft request per facility at a time.

**Q: What happens if my funding request is rejected?**

A: If your funding request is rejected, no funding notice is created, and the drawdown doesn't proceed. You receive a rejection reason. You can create a new funding request addressing the issues that led to rejection.

**Q: Can I edit a funding request after submitting it?**

A: No, once submitted, you cannot edit funding requests while they're under review. If changes are requested, you can edit and resubmit. Otherwise, you must wait for the facility agent's decision.

**Q: How long does funding request review take?**

A: Review time varies depending on facility agent workload and request complexity. Typically, reviews take a few days. You'll receive notifications when decisions are made.

### Funding Notice Questions

**Q: Why do I need to approve token transfer?**

A: Borrower token approval makes the funding notice visible to lenders. Until you approve, lenders cannot see the funding notice. Approval authorizes the token transfer and enables lender review.

**Q: What are tokens?**

A: Tokens represent drawdown amounts digitally. They enable tracking and distribution to lenders. Tokens are allocated to lenders based on their participation percentages in the facility. They facilitate the fund transfer process.

**Q: When are tokens generated?**

A: Tokens are generated by facility agents after funding requests are approved. Facility agents generate tokens and configure distribution to lenders. After tokens are generated, you can approve the token transfer.

**Q: Can I see which lenders have approved drawdowns?**

A: Yes, you can see which lenders have approved or rejected drawdowns. Each lender's decision is tracked individually, showing approval or rejection status. This information is visible on the funding notice details page.

**Q: How long does it take for funds to be transferred?**

A: Fund transfer timing depends on lender processes. After lenders approve drawdowns, they transfer funds and confirm transfers. Transfer timing varies by lender. You'll receive funds as lenders confirm transfers.

**Q: What happens if a lender rejects a drawdown?**

A: If a lender rejects a drawdown, that lender doesn't participate in that drawdown. Other lenders make independent decisions. You receive funds only from lenders who approve. Rejected lenders don't fund their portion.

### Approval Process Questions

**Q: Why do approvals take time?**

A: Approvals require careful review to ensure quality, compliance, and proper evaluation. Reviewers need time to evaluate submissions thoroughly. Review time varies based on complexity and workload.

**Q: Can I speed up approvals?**

A: You can ensure your submissions are complete and accurate, which helps reviewers evaluate quickly. However, review time depends on reviewer workload and cannot be controlled by submitters.

**Q: What if I disagree with a rejection?**

A: Rejections are final decisions. You cannot appeal rejections, but you can create new submissions addressing the rejection reasons. Use rejection feedback to improve future submissions.

**Q: Can I see approval history?**

A: Yes, you can view approval history on item details pages. History shows who approved or rejected, when decisions were made, and any comments or reasons provided.
