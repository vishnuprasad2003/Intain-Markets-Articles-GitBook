# Common User Questions

## Overview

This guide answers common questions users have about pools, loans, and general platform usage. These FAQs help you quickly find answers to typical questions and understand how the platform works.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Pool Questions

**Q: Can I edit a pool after sharing it?**

A: Yes, you can usually edit pools while they're in Preview status. Once a pool reaches Deal status, editing is typically restricted. Check the pool status to see what editing options are available.

**Q: How many loans can I add to a pool?**

A: There's no specific limit on the number of loans you can add to a pool. Add as many loans as needed for your transaction. The system will calculate pool metrics automatically from all mapped loans.

**Q: What happens if I remove a loan from a pool?**

A: When you remove a loan from a pool, the loan is excluded from pool calculations. Pool metrics (total balance, loan count, weighted averages) update automatically. The loan remains visible in the pool but is marked as removed. You can reinstate it later if needed.

**Q: Can I share a pool with multiple organizations at once?**

A: Yes, you can share a pool with multiple organizations simultaneously. You don't need to share with one organization at a time.

**Q: What's the difference between Created and Preview status?**

A: Created status means the pool is visible only to you. Preview status means the pool has been shared with other organizations for review.

### Loan Questions

**Q: Can a loan be in multiple pools?**

A: No, a loan can only belong to one pool at a time. To move a loan to another pool, you must first remove it (unmap it) from the current pool, then map it to the new pool.

**Q: What's the difference between unmapped and mapped loans?**

A: Unmapped loans exist in the system but are not assigned to any pool. Mapped loans are assigned to a specific pool and are included in pool calculations.

**Q: Can I delete a loan?**

A: You can usually delete unmapped loans that haven't been verified or used in transactions. Once a loan is verified, mapped to a pool, or used in transactions, deletion may be restricted. Check the loan status to see deletion options.

**Q: What happens to pool metrics when I remove a loan?**

A: Pool metrics recalculate automatically when loans are removed. Total balance decreases, loan count decreases, and weighted averages recalculate to exclude the removed loan.

**Q: Can I reinstate a removed loan?**

A: Yes, you can reinstate removed loans. When reinstated, the loan is included in pool calculations again, and pool metrics update automatically.

### General Platform Questions

**Q: How do I switch between roles?**

A: Log out and log back in with a different role. Each role has its own view and permissions. You select your role during login from a dropdown menu.

**Q: Why are some buttons disabled?**

A: Buttons are disabled for several reasons: wrong status for the action, missing required information, waiting for another party to act, action already completed, or no permission for your role. Hover over disabled buttons to see tooltips explaining why they're disabled.

**Q: How do I know what actions are available to me?**

A: Enabled buttons show actions you can take. Disabled buttons show actions that aren't available (with reasons). Your role and the item's status determine what actions are available.

**Q: Can I see who changed an item's status?**

A: Yes, you can view status history on item details pages. Status history shows who changed the status and when, along with previous and new statuses.

**Q: How do I track my submissions?**

A: You can track submissions by viewing their status. Status shows where items are in their workflow. You can also view status history to see all changes and actions.

**Q: What happens if my session expires?**

A: If your session expires, you'll need to log in again. The platform remembers your preferences and shows you relevant information for your role.

**Q: Can I download pool or loan data?**

A: Download capabilities depend on sharing permissions set by issuers. If you have download permissions, you can download data. Check with the issuer if you need download access.

**Q: How do I provide feedback on pools?**

A: If sharing permissions allow feedback, you can provide feedback through the pool's feedback section. You can provide pool-level or loan-level feedback, and can mark it as a change request if modifications are needed.

**Q: What's the difference between feedback and rejection?**

A: Feedback (change requests) allows you to request modifications - items can be edited and resubmitted. Rejection is final - rejected items cannot be resubmitted and must be replaced with new items.

**Q: How long do approvals take?**

A: Approval times vary depending on reviewer workload and complexity. You'll receive notifications when decisions are made. Check with reviewers if you have concerns about timing.
