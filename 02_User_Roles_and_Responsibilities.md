# User Roles and Responsibilities

## Overview

Intain Markets uses distinct user roles, each with specific responsibilities and access permissions. Your role determines what actions you can take, what information you can see, and what you're responsible for in the structured finance workflow.

## What This Means for the User

When you log in, you select your role from a dropdown menu. The same email address can have multiple roles, but you must select one role per login session. Your selected role determines:

- What items appear in your dashboard and lists
- What actions are available to you
- What information you can view
- What responsibilities you have in the workflow

The platform automatically filters information based on your role, showing you only what's relevant and making it easier to focus on your responsibilities.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Issuer (Borrower)

Issuers are organizations that own loans and want to structure them into pools for securitization or whole loan sales. Issuers can:

- Create pools and assign loans to them
- Share pools with market makers, investors, and other parties
- Submit term sheets for credit facilities
- Manage loan data and pool information
- Respond to feedback and make changes
- View their pools and track status changes

Issuers cannot approve their own submissions - they must wait for other parties to review and approve.

### Market Maker (Facility Agent)

Market Makers help structure deals and facilitate transactions. They can:

- Review pools shared with them
- Accept or reject mandates to structure deals
- Provide feedback and request changes on pools
- Review and approve term sheets
- Structure deals and move pools toward completion
- View pools they're involved with

Market Makers cannot create pools or term sheets themselves, but they play a crucial role in reviewing and structuring transactions.

### Investor (Lender)

Investors provide funding for transactions. They can:

- Review pools and investment opportunities shared with them
- Review and approve credit facilities and term sheets
- Approve or reject funding requests
- Review master commitments and facility setups
- View their investments and track status
- Express interest in opportunities

Investors cannot create pools or term sheets, but they make funding decisions and approve transactions.

### Servicer

Servicers manage ongoing loan administration after deals are completed. They can:

- View pools and loans assigned to them
- Manage loan servicing activities
- Track payments and loan performance
- Update loan statuses and information
- Handle ongoing administration tasks

Servicers focus on post-deal management and ensuring loans are properly serviced.

### Paying Agent

Paying Agents handle payment distributions. They can:

- View pools and facilities assigned to them
- Manage payment distributions
- Ensure funds are properly allocated
- Handle payment-related tasks

Paying Agents ensure that payments are distributed correctly to all parties.

### Rating Agency

Rating Agencies analyze pools for rating purposes. They can:

- View pools shared with them
- Access pool and loan data for analysis
- Review pool characteristics and metrics
- Perform rating analysis

Rating Agencies have read-only access to analyze pools but cannot make changes or approvals.

### Admin

Admins have system-level access for platform administration. They can:

- Manage users and organizations
- Configure system settings
- Access administrative functions
- Handle platform-level tasks

Admins support the platform but typically don't participate in regular business transactions.

## Important Points to Know

- You must select the correct role during login that matches your account. If you have multiple roles, you can log in with different roles at different times.

- Your role determines your view - you only see items where you have a role or where items are shared with you.

- Action buttons are enabled or disabled based on your role and the item's status. Disabled buttons usually show a reason why the action isn't available.

- Some users may have multiple roles (for example, an organization might be both an issuer and an investor), but you can only use one role per session.

- Role-based permissions ensure proper workflow - issuers cannot approve their own submissions, and each role has appropriate responsibilities.

- The platform enforces role-based rules automatically, so you can only take actions that are appropriate for your role.

- Collaboration between roles is essential - issuers create, market makers structure, investors fund, and servicers manage ongoing administration.

Understanding your role and the roles of others helps you navigate the platform effectively, know what actions you can take, and understand how different parties collaborate to complete structured finance transactions.
