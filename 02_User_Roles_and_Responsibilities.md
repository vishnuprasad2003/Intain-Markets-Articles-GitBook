# User Roles and Responsibilities

## Overview

Intain Markets uses distinct user roles, each with specific responsibilities and access permissions. Your role determines what actions you can take and what you're responsible for.

## Who Can Use This

- Issuers (Borrowers)
- Market Makers and Facility Agents
- Investors and Lenders
- Servicers
- Paying Agents
- Rating Agencies

## When This Is Used

Understanding roles helps you:
- Know what actions you can take
- Understand what you're responsible for
- Know who can perform specific actions
- Understand collaboration between parties

## Step-by-Step Process

### Understanding Your Role

1. **Identify Your Role**
   - Your role is shown when you log in
   - Select the correct role from the dropdown during login
   - Your role determines your dashboard and available features

2. **Review Role Responsibilities**
   - Issuers create pools, submit term sheets, and manage loans
   - Facility Agents review submissions and structure deals
   - Lenders review opportunities and approve funding
   - Servicers manage ongoing loan administration
   - Paying Agents handle payment distributions

3. **Use Role-Specific Features**
   - Access features available to your role
   - See only relevant items in your view
   - Take actions permitted for your role

## Rules & Validations

- Each role has specific permissions and cannot perform actions reserved for other roles
- Issuers cannot approve their own term sheets or funding requests
- Facility Agents cannot create term sheets but can review and approve them
- Lenders cannot create pools or term sheets but can approve facilities and funding
- Some users may have multiple roles but must select one role per login session

## What Happens Next

After understanding your role:
- You can navigate the platform knowing what's available to you
