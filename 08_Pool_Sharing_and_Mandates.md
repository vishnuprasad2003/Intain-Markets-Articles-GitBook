# Pool Sharing and Mandates

## Overview

Sharing pools allows you to collaborate with other organizations in the structured finance process. You can share pools with market makers, investors, rating agencies, and other parties who need to review or participate in your transaction. Mandates are formal requests to market makers to structure deals, and managing mandates is a key part of moving pools toward completion.

## Who Can Use This

- Issuers who create pools and want to share them with other parties
- Market Makers who receive pool shares and review mandate requests
- Investors who receive pool previews for investment opportunities
- Rating Agencies and other parties involved in transactions

## When This Is Used

Use pool sharing when you:
- Want market makers to review pools and accept mandates to structure deals
- Need investors to see investment opportunities and express interest
- Want rating agencies to analyze pools for rating purposes
- Need to collaborate with multiple parties on a transaction
- Want to get feedback before finalizing a pool

Use mandates when you:
- Have a pool ready for structuring
- Want a market maker to formally commit to structuring the deal
- Need to move a pool from preview to deal status
- Want to establish a formal relationship with a market maker for deal structuring

## Step-by-Step Process

### Sharing a Pool

1. **Prepare Your Pool**
   - Ensure pool information is complete and accurate
   - Map loans to the pool and verify loan data
   - Review pool metrics for accuracy (total balance, loan count, weighted averages)
   - Verify all details are correct before sharing
   - Ensure pool is in Created or Preview status (you can only share pools in these statuses)

2. **Access Sharing Settings**
   - Navigate to your pool's details page
   - Find the sharing or organization assignment section
   - Click to add or modify sharing settings

3. **Select Recipient Organizations**
   - Choose which organizations to share with from available options
   - Select market makers for structuring and mandate review
   - Select investors for investment opportunities
   - Select rating agencies for analysis
   - Select other parties as needed (servicers, paying agents, etc.)
   - You can share with multiple organizations simultaneously

4. **Set Sharing Permissions**
   - Control what recipients can see and do with the pool
   - Allow or restrict feedback capabilities
   - Allow or restrict download permissions
   - Set appropriate access levels for each organization type
   - Configure whether recipients can request changes

5. **Complete the Sharing Process**
   - Review your sharing selections
   - Confirm the sharing action
   - Recipients receive notifications that the pool has been shared
   - Pool becomes visible to shared parties in their views
   - Pool status may change to Preview if it was in Created status

6. **Verify Sharing**
   - Confirm that recipients can see the pool
   - Check that sharing permissions are set correctly
   - Verify notifications were sent

### Managing Mandates

1. **Prepare Pool for Mandate Submission**
   - Ensure pool is shared with the market maker
   - Verify pool information is complete
   - Review pool metrics and loan characteristics
   - Ensure pool meets requirements for mandate submission
   - Pool should be in Preview status

2. **Submit Pool for Mandate**
   - Navigate to the pool's mandate or submission section
   - Select the market maker you want to submit to
   - Review mandate details and requirements
   - Submit the pool for mandate review
   - Status changes to Mandate Pending
   - Market maker receives notification

3. **Market Maker Reviews the Pool**
   - Market maker sees the pool in their view
   - Market maker analyzes pool details, metrics, and loan characteristics
   - Market maker reviews pool composition and quality
   - Market maker evaluates whether to accept the mandate
   - Market maker can request changes or provide feedback before deciding

4. **Market Maker Makes Decision**
   - **Accept**: Market maker accepts the mandate and commits to structuring the deal
     - Pool status changes to Deal
     - Market maker proceeds with deal structuring
     - Pool moves forward in the workflow
   - **Reject**: Market maker declines the mandate
     - Pool may return to Preview status
     - You can submit to another market maker
     - You receive notification of rejection
   - **Request Changes**: Market maker provides feedback and requests modifications
     - Pool remains in Mandate Pending or returns to Preview
     - You can make changes and resubmit

5. **Handle Mandate Acceptance**
   - If accepted, pool moves to Deal status
   - Market maker proceeds with structuring activities
   - Editing is restricted as pool is finalized
   - All parties are notified of mandate acceptance
   - Deal moves toward completion

6. **Handle Mandate Rejection**
   - If rejected, review the reason for rejection
   - Make improvements if needed
   - Submit to another market maker if desired
   - Pool returns to Preview status for further work

## Rules & Validations

- You can only share pools while they're in Created or Preview status. Once a pool reaches Deal status, sharing is typically not needed as it's already finalized.

- Sharing permissions control what recipients can do. Some recipients may have view-only access, while others can provide feedback or request changes.

- A pool can be shared with multiple parties simultaneously. You don't need to share with one party at a time.

- Market makers can accept or reject mandates. They cannot be forced to accept, and rejection is a valid outcome.

- Mandate acceptance moves pool toward Deal status. Once accepted, the pool is committed to that market maker for structuring.

- You can share with different market makers if one rejects. Rejection doesn't prevent you from submitting to another market maker.

- Pool status affects sharing capabilities. Some statuses may restrict sharing or mandate submission.

- Recipients must have appropriate roles. Market makers can accept mandates, investors can review opportunities, etc.

- Sharing is recorded in audit trail. All sharing actions are tracked with who shared what with whom and when.

- Mandate decisions are final. Once a market maker accepts or rejects, that decision is recorded and affects pool status.

## What Happens Next

After sharing a pool:
- Recipients can view and analyze the pool in their views
- Market makers can review and accept mandates to structure deals
- Investors can review opportunities and express interest
- Rating agencies can analyze pool characteristics for rating purposes
- You receive feedback and can respond accordingly
- Pool may progress through statuses based on recipient actions

After submitting for mandate:
- Market maker receives notification and reviews the pool
- Market maker makes a decision (accept, reject, or request changes)
- Pool status updates based on the decision
- If accepted, pool moves to Deal status and market maker structures the deal
- If rejected, you can submit to another market maker or make improvements

After mandate acceptance:
- Pool is finalized and moves to Deal status
- Market maker proceeds with deal structuring
- Editing is restricted as pool is committed
- Deal moves toward completion
- All parties are notified and can track progress

Pool sharing and mandates enable collaboration with other parties, helping you move pools through the structured finance workflow and complete successful transactions with proper structuring and approvals.
