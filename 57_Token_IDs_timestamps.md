# Token IDs and Timestamps

## Overview

Tokens created for funding notices have unique identifiers and timestamps that enable complete tracking and auditability. Understanding token IDs and timestamps helps you track token creation, distribution, and transfers, ensuring complete transparency in the token-based drawdown process.

## What This Means for the User

When tokens are generated for funding notices:

- **Unique Identification**: Each token has a unique ID that enables tracking and verification.

- **Timestamp Tracking**: Every token event is timestamped, showing exactly when things happened.

- **Complete Audit Trail**: Token IDs and timestamps create complete audit trails.

- **Verification**: You can verify token information using IDs and timestamps.

- **Transparency**: Complete tracking ensures transparency in token distribution and transfers.

Understanding token IDs and timestamps helps you track tokens throughout their lifecycle and verify token information.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Token IDs

Token IDs are unique identifiers:

- **Unique Identifiers**: Each token has a unique ID that distinguishes it from other tokens.

- **Enable Tracking**: Token IDs enable tracking of individual tokens through their lifecycle.

- **Link to Records**: Token IDs link to blockchain records and platform records.

- **Maintain Audit Trail**: IDs help maintain complete audit trails.

- **Enable Transfers**: Token IDs enable token transfers and tracking.

### Timestamps

Timestamps record when events occurred:

- **Precise Time Recording**: Timestamps record exactly when events happened.

- **Complete Chronology**: Timestamps create complete chronological records of token activities.

- **Audit Trail Component**: Timestamps are essential components of audit trails.

- **Process Tracking**: Timestamps help track process progression.

- **Verification**: Timestamps enable verification of when events occurred.

### What Gets Timestamped

Various token events are timestamped:

- **Token Creation**: When tokens are created is recorded.

- **Token Distribution**: When tokens are distributed to lenders is recorded.

- **Borrower Approval**: When borrower approves token transfer is recorded.

- **Lender Receipt**: When lenders receive tokens is recorded.

- **Token Transfer**: When tokens are transferred is recorded.

- **All Events**: All significant token events are timestamped.

### Where Token IDs and Timestamps Appear

Token IDs and timestamps appear in:

- **Funding Notice Details**: Token information is shown in funding notice details.

- **Token Distribution Information**: Token allocation shows IDs and timestamps.

- **Blockchain Records**: Token IDs link to blockchain records.

- **Transaction History**: Token activities are recorded in transaction history.

- **Audit Trails**: Complete audit trails include IDs and timestamps.

## Important Points to Know

- Token IDs are unique and cannot be changed - each token has a permanent unique identifier.

- Timestamps are accurate and consistent - all timestamps use consistent time standards.

- All token events are timestamped - every significant token event includes a timestamp.

- Complete history is maintained - all token activities are recorded with IDs and timestamps.

- Audit trail is preserved - complete audit trails are maintained for compliance.

- Token IDs enable verification - you can verify token information using IDs.

- Timestamps show progression - timestamps show how tokens progressed through the process.

- Complete transparency - all token activities are tracked and visible to authorized parties.

- Blockchain integration - Token IDs link to blockchain records for additional verification.

- Easy to track - Token IDs and timestamps make it easy to track tokens throughout their lifecycle.

Understanding token IDs and timestamps helps you track tokens throughout their lifecycle, verify token information, maintain complete audit trails, understand token distribution timing, and ensure transparency in the token-based drawdown process.
