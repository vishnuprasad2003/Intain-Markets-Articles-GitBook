# Token IDs and Timestamps

## Overview

Tokens created for funding notices have unique identifiers and timestamps that enable complete tracking and auditability. Understanding token IDs and timestamps helps you track token creation, distribution, and transfers.

## Who Can Use This

- Borrowers who receive tokens
- Facility Agents who generate tokens
- Lenders who receive token allocations

## When This Is Used

Understanding token IDs and timestamps helps when:
- You need to track token creation
- You want to verify token information
- You need audit information
- You want to understand token tracking

## Step-by-Step Process

### Understanding Token IDs

1. **What Token IDs Are**
   - Unique identifiers for each token
   - Enable tracking and verification
   - Link to blockchain records
   - Maintain audit trail
   - Enable transfers

2. **Where Token IDs Appear**
   - Funding notice details
   - Token distribution information
   - Blockchain records
   - Transaction history
   - Audit trails

### Understanding Timestamps

1. **What Timestamps Are**
   - Record of when events occurred
   - Precise time recording
   - Complete chronology
   - Audit trail component
   - Process tracking

2. **What Gets Timestamped**
   - Token creation time
   - Token distribution time
   - Token transfer time
   - Borrower approval time
   - Lender receipt time

### Tracking Tokens

1. **Creation Timestamp**
   - Shows when tokens were created
   - Links to creation event
   - Records creation time
   - Maintains audit trail

2. **Distribution Timestamp**
   - Shows when tokens were distributed
   - Records distribution time
   - Tracks allocation timing
   - Maintains complete history

## Rules & Validations

- Token IDs are unique and cannot be changed
- Timestamps are accurate and consistent
- All token events are timestamped
- Complete history is maintained
- Audit trail is preserved

## What Happens Next

After understanding token IDs and timestamps:
- You can track token creation and distribution
- You know when tokens were created
- You can verify token information
- You have complete audit information
- You understand token tracking

Understanding token IDs and timestamps helps you track tokens throughout their lifecycle and maintain complete audit trails.
