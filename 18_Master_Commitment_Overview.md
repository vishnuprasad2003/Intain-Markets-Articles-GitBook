# Master Commitment Overview

## Overview

A master commitment is the finalized credit facility agreement that defines the complete facility structure. It's automatically created when a term sheet is approved and contains all the rules, parameters, and lender information needed to operate the facility.

## Who Can Use This

- Facility Agents who configure master commitments
- Borrowers who monitor facility setup
- Lenders who approve facilities

## When This Is Used

Use master commitments when:
- Your term sheet has been approved
- You need to set up the complete facility structure
- You want to understand how facilities are configured
- You need to approve a facility as a lender

## Step-by-Step Process

### Master Commitment Creation

1. **Automatic Creation**
   - Master commitment is automatically created when term sheet is approved
   - Pre-populated with term sheet data
   - Ready for facility agent configuration

2. **Facility Agent Configuration**
   - Facility agent sets up facility rules
   - Configures borrowing base calculations
   - Defines collateral eligibility rules
   - Adds and configures lender groups

3. **Submission for Approval**
   - Facility agent completes all required fields
   - Submits for lender approval
   - Status changes to show it's pending approval

4. **Lender Approval**
   - Lenders review master commitment
   - Any lender approval activates the facility
   - Facility becomes active and operational

## Rules & Validations

- Master commitments are automatically created from approved term sheets
- Facility agents must complete all required fields before submission
- At least one lender must be configured
- Any lender approval activates the facility
- Once active, borrowers can create funding requests

## What Happens Next

After master commitment is created:
- Facility agent configures facility rules and lenders
- Facility agent submits for lender approval
- Lenders review and approve
- Facility becomes active when approved
- Borrowers can create funding requests against active facilities

Understanding master commitments helps you know how facilities are structured and what happens after your term sheet is approved.
