# Funding Request Review

## Overview

Funding request review is the process where facility agents evaluate borrower funding requests to ensure they comply with facility rules, have sufficient borrowing capacity, and meet all requirements before approval.

## Who Can Use This

- Facility Agents who review funding requests

## When This Is Used

Use funding request review when:
- Borrowers submit funding requests
- You need to evaluate requests for compliance
- You want to approve or reject drawdowns
- You need to ensure facility rules are followed

## Step-by-Step Process

### Reviewing a Funding Request

1. **Access Request**
   - View submitted funding requests
   - Open request details
   - Review all information

2. **Evaluate Compliance**
   - Check request amount is within facility limits
   - Verify sufficient borrowing capacity available
   - Confirm request meets facility rules
   - Review drawdown frequency compliance

3. **Review Documentation**
   - Check all required documents are included
   - Verify document quality and accuracy
   - Ensure documents support the request
   - Confirm documentation meets requirements

4. **Assess Collateral** (if applicable)
   - Verify collateral eligibility
   - Check collateral valuation
   - Confirm collateral not already pledged
   - Ensure collateral concentration within limits

5. **Make Decision**
   - Approve if all requirements met
   - Reject if requirements not met
   - Request changes if improvements needed

## Rules & Validations

- Requests must comply with all facility rules
- Request amount cannot exceed available borrowing capacity
- All required documentation must be provided
- Collateral must meet eligibility criteria if applicable
- Approved requests automatically generate funding notices

## What Happens Next

After reviewing a funding request:
- If approved, funding notice is automatically created
- If rejected, borrower receives reason and can create new request
- If changes requested, borrower can update and resubmit
- Status updates reflect your decision
- Borrowers are notified of the outcome

Understanding funding request review helps facility agents effectively evaluate requests and ensure facility rules are followed.
