# Funding Request Review

## Overview

Funding request review is the process where facility agents evaluate borrower funding requests to ensure they comply with facility rules, have sufficient borrowing capacity, meet all requirements, and are properly documented before approval. This review process ensures proper oversight and control over fund disbursement while maintaining facility integrity.

## Who Can Use This

- Facility Agents who review funding requests and make approval decisions
- Borrowers who want to understand how their requests are evaluated

## When This Is Used

Use funding request review when:
- Borrowers submit funding requests against active facilities
- You need to evaluate requests for compliance with facility rules
- You want to approve or reject drawdowns based on evaluation
- You need to ensure facility rules are followed
- You want to verify borrowing capacity and documentation

## Step-by-Step Process

## Rules & Validations

- Requests must comply with all facility rules. Any violation results in rejection or change request.

- Request amount cannot exceed available borrowing capacity. Capacity is calculated based on facility rules and current utilization.

- All required documentation must be provided. Missing or inadequate documentation results in rejection or change request.

- Collateral must meet eligibility criteria if applicable. Ineligible collateral results in rejection or change request.

- Approved requests automatically generate funding notices. You don't need to create notices manually.

- Rejected requests cannot be resubmitted. Borrowers must create new requests if rejected.

- Change requests allow editing and resubmission. Borrowers can update requests and resubmit without creating new ones.

- Decisions are final once submitted. You cannot easily reverse decisions after submission.

- All reviews are recorded. Every decision, reason, and action is tracked in the audit trail.

- Status controls workflow. Request status determines what actions are available and what happens next.

## What Happens Next

After reviewing a funding request:
- If approved, funding notice is automatically created and sent to lenders
- If rejected, borrower receives reason and can create new request
- If changes requested, borrower can update and resubmit
- Status updates reflect your decision
- Borrowers are notified of the outcome

After approval:
- Funding notice is generated automatically
- Notice is sent to lenders for review
- Lenders review and approve or reject drawdowns
- After lender approval, funds are transferred
- Borrower receives the funds

Understanding funding request review helps facility agents effectively evaluate requests, ensure facility rules are followed, maintain proper oversight, and make informed approval decisions that protect facility integrity while serving borrower needs.
