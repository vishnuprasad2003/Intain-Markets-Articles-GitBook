# Term Sheet Review

## Overview

Term sheet review is the process where facility agents evaluate term sheets submitted by borrowers and decide whether to approve, reject, or request changes. This guide covers how facility agents review term sheets effectively, assess proposals, and make decisions that affect facility setup workflow.

## Who Can Use This

- Facility Agents who review term sheets submitted by borrowers

## When This Is Used

Use term sheet review when:
- Borrowers submit term sheets for your review
- You need to evaluate facility proposals
- You want to approve or reject term sheets

## Step-by-Step Process

### Reviewing Term Sheets

1. **Access Term Sheet**
   - Check notifications for new term sheet submissions
   - Navigate to term sheets for review
   - Open term sheet details
   - Review all information provided

2. **Evaluate Facility Terms**
   - **Facility Amount**: Assess if amount is appropriate and reasonable
   - **Interest Rate**: Evaluate interest rate or rate structure
   - **Repayment Terms**: Review how repayments are structured
   - **Facility Term**: Check duration and maturity
   - **Purpose**: Understand what funds will be used for
   - **Other Terms**: Review all facility terms and conditions

3. **Assess Facility Structure**
   - Evaluate overall facility structure
   - Review facility type and characteristics
   - Assess facility complexity
   - Check if structure is appropriate
   - Evaluate feasibility

4. **Assess Borrower Creditworthiness**
   - Review borrower financial information
   - Evaluate credit history and standing
   - Assess borrower capacity
   - Check borrower qualifications
   - Review borrower track record

5. **Review Documentation**

### Making Review Decisions

1. **Approve Term Sheet**
   - Review thoroughly and verify all requirements met
   - Assess that proposal is sound and feasible
   - Click "Approve" button or similar
   - Enter approval comments if needed
   - Confirm approval
   - Master commitment is automatically created
   - Status changes to "Accepted"

2. **Reject Term Sheet**
   - Review and identify issues or concerns
   - Determine proposal doesn't meet requirements
   - Click "Reject" button or similar
   - Provide detailed rejection reason
   - Enter comments explaining rejection
   - Confirm rejection
   - Status changes to "Rejected"
   - Borrower can create new term sheet

3. **Request Changes**
   - Identify needed modifications
   - Determine improvements that would make proposal acceptable
   - Click "Request Changes" button or similar
   - Provide detailed change request
   - Enter specific modifications needed
   - Confirm change request
   - Status changes to "CHANGES_REQUESTED"
   - Borrower can update and resubmit

## Rules & Validations

- You can approve, reject, or request changes - three options allow you to handle different situations appropriately.

- Approved term sheets automatically create master commitments - you don't need to create master commitments manually.

- Rejected term sheets cannot be resubmitted - borrowers must create new term sheets if rejected.

- Change requests allow borrowers to update and resubmit - this enables iterative improvement without starting over.

- Your decision affects facility setup workflow - approval moves to master commitment configuration, rejection stops the process, change requests allow refinement.

- Decisions are final once submitted - you cannot easily reverse decisions after submission.

- Complete audit trail - all decisions, reasons, and comments are recorded with timestamps.

- Borrower notifications - borrowers receive notifications when you make decisions.

- Status updates reflect decisions - term sheet status changes based on your decision.

- Review thoroughly before deciding - take time to evaluate all aspects before making decisions.

## What Happens Next

After reviewing a term sheet:
- **If Approved**: Master commitment is automatically created, you configure the facility structure, you submit master commitment for lender approval, facility becomes active when lenders approve, and borrowers can create funding requests.

- **If Rejected**: Borrower receives rejection reason, borrower can create a new term sheet addressing issues, new term sheet goes through same review process, and process can start over with improvements.

- **If Changes Requested**: Borrower receives change request details, borrower updates term sheet with requested changes, borrower resubmits for your review, you review again and make new decision, and process can repeat until approved or rejected.

After approval:
- Master commitment is automatically created with "Draft" status
- You configure facility rules, borrowing base, and lender groups
- You submit master commitment for lender approval
- Lenders review and approve the facility
- Facility becomes active, and borrowers can create funding requests

Understanding term sheet review helps facility agents effectively evaluate proposals, ensure facility requirements are met, make informed decisions, and move facilities through the setup workflow to active status.
