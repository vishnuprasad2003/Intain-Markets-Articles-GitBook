# Facility Approval

## Overview

Facility approval is the process where lenders review master commitments and approve them, activating the credit facility. This guide covers how lenders evaluate facilities, assess facility structure and terms, and make approval decisions that activate facilities for borrower use.

## Who Can Use This

- Lenders who receive master commitments for approval

## When This Is Used

Use facility approval when:
- Master commitments are submitted for your approval
- You need to evaluate facility proposals
- You want to activate credit facilities
- You're making facility participation decisions
- You're deciding whether to participate in facilities

## Step-by-Step Process

### Reviewing Master Commitments

1. **Access Master Commitment**
   - Check notifications for new master commitments
   - Navigate to master commitments for approval
   - Open master commitment details
   - Review all information provided

2. **Evaluate Facility Structure**
   - **Facility Terms**: Review facility amount, interest rates, and maturity
   - **Facility Rules**: Assess facility rules and parameters
   - **Borrowing Base**: Review borrowing base configuration and calculations
   - **Collateral Rules**: Evaluate collateral eligibility and valuation methods
   - **Overall Structure**: Assess overall facility structure and complexity

3. **Review Lender Configuration**
   - Check your commitment amount
   - Review your participation percentage
   - Understand voting rights and decision-making
   - Verify lender-specific terms
   - Review other lenders' participation
   - Assess lender group structure

4. **Assess Facility Setup**
   - Evaluate facility setup completeness
   - Review calculation methods
   - Check rule definitions
   - Verify configuration quality
   - Assess facility readiness

5. **Evaluate Risk and Return**
   - Assess facility risk profile
   - Evaluate borrower creditworthiness
   - Review facility terms and conditions
   - Assess return potential
   - Consider your risk tolerance

### Making Approval Decisions

1. **Approve Master Commitment**
   - Review thoroughly and evaluate facility structure
   - Assess that facility meets your criteria
   - Click "Approve" button or similar
   - Initiate electronic signature process
   - Review master commitment document
   - Complete electronic signature
   - Confirm approval
   - Facility becomes active (if first lender approval)
   - Status changes to "ACTIVE"

2. **Reject Master Commitment**
   - Review and identify concerns or issues
   - Determine facility doesn't meet your criteria
   - Click "Reject" button or similar
   - Provide rejection reason if needed
   - Enter comments explaining rejection
   - Confirm rejection
   - Your rejection doesn't prevent other lenders from approving

## Rules & Validations

- Any lender approval activates the facility - you don't need all lenders to approve before facility becomes active.

- You can only approve master commitments pending approval - you cannot approve facilities that are already active or in other statuses.

- Electronic signature is required for approval - your approval must be signed electronically for legal validity.

- Once approved, facility becomes active - facility status changes to "Active" and borrowers can create funding requests.

- Your approval decision is tracked individually - each lender's approval status is tracked separately.

- Rejection doesn't prevent activation - other lenders can still approve and activate the facility.

- Decisions are final once submitted - you cannot easily reverse approval decisions.

- Complete audit trail - all approvals and rejections are recorded with timestamps and details.

- Borrower and facility agent notifications - parties are notified when facilities are approved and activated.

- Individual tracking - each lender's approval status is tracked independently.

## What Happens Next

After approving a master commitment:
- Facility becomes active and operational (if first lender approval)
- Status changes to "ACTIVE"
- Borrowers can create funding requests
- Facility agent can manage active facility
- You can participate in funding
- Facility is fully functional

After facility activation:
- Borrowers create funding requests
- Facility agent reviews and approves requests
- Funding notices are generated
- You review and approve individual drawdowns
- Funds are transferred as you confirm
- Facility operates according to configured rules

After rejection:
- Your rejection is recorded
- Other lenders can still approve
- Facility may become active if other lenders approve
- You don't participate in the facility
- You can participate in future facilities

Understanding facility approval helps lenders effectively evaluate facilities, assess facility structure and terms, make informed participation decisions, and activate credit facilities for borrower use.
