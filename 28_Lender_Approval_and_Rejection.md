# Lender Approval and Rejection

## Overview

Lenders review funding notices and can approve or reject individual drawdowns. Each lender makes their own independent decision, and the system tracks individual lender participation separately. This allows lenders to evaluate each drawdown based on their own criteria and participate or decline as they see fit.

## Who Can Use This

- Lenders who receive funding notices after borrower token approval

## When This Is Used

Use lender approval when:
- Funding notice becomes visible after borrower approves token transfer
- You need to review a drawdown request
- You want to approve or reject participation in a drawdown
- You need to make a decision on whether to fund your portion
- You want to evaluate drawdown details before committing funds

## Step-by-Step Process

## Rules & Validations

- Each lender makes independent decision - your decision doesn't affect other lenders' choices.

- Your decision doesn't affect other lenders - other lenders can approve or reject independently.

- You can approve or reject based on your evaluation - make decisions based on your own criteria and risk tolerance.

- Approved lenders can proceed with fund transfer - if you approve, you can transfer your portion of funds.

- Rejected lenders don't participate in that drawdown - if you reject, you won't fund your portion, but other lenders can still participate.

- Decisions are final once submitted - you cannot easily change your decision after submitting.

- Rejection reasons help borrowers understand - providing reasons helps borrowers understand lender concerns.

- Individual tracking - each lender's decision is tracked separately with timestamps and details.

- Borrower visibility - borrowers can see which lenders approved and which rejected.

- Complete audit trail - all decisions are recorded with who made what decision and when.

## What Happens Next

After making your decision:
- **If Approved**: You can proceed with fund transfer, transfer your allocated portion to the borrower, confirm the transfer, and your participation is complete.

- **If Rejected**: You don't participate in this drawdown, other lenders make their own decisions independently, borrower can see your rejection, and you can participate in future drawdowns.

After all lenders decide:
- Approved lenders transfer funds and confirm transfers
- Borrower receives funds from approved lenders
- Drawdown process completes as transfers are confirmed
- Borrower can track which lenders participated
- Complete documentation is maintained

Understanding lender approval and rejection helps you make informed decisions on drawdowns, participate effectively in credit facilities, and manage your participation based on your own evaluation criteria and risk tolerance.
