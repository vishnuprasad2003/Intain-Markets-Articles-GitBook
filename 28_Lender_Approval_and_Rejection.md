# Lender Approval and Rejection

## Overview

Lenders review funding notices and can approve or reject individual drawdowns. Each lender makes their own decision, and the system tracks individual lender participation separately.

## Who Can Use This

- Lenders who receive funding notices

## When This Is Used

Use lender approval when:
- Funding notice becomes visible after borrower approval
- You need to review a drawdown request
- You want to approve or reject participation
- You need to make a decision on a drawdown

## Step-by-Step Process

### Reviewing Funding Notice

1. **Access Funding Notice**
   - View funding notices available for review
   - Open notice details
   - Review drawdown information

2. **Evaluate Drawdown**
   - Review request amount
   - Check purpose of funds
   - Verify facility details
   - Assess borrowing base impact
   - Review your token allocation

### Making Decision

1. **Approve Drawdown**
   - Click approve button if you want to participate
   - Confirm your approval
   - Your participation is confirmed
   - Drawdown can proceed for your portion

2. **Reject Drawdown**
   - Click reject button if you don't want to participate
   - Provide rejection reason if required
   - Confirm your rejection
   - Your portion will not be funded

## Rules & Validations

- Each lender makes independent decision
- Your decision doesn't affect other lenders
- You can approve or reject based on your evaluation
- Approved lenders can proceed with fund transfer
- Rejected lenders don't participate in that drawdown

## What Happens Next

After making your decision:
- If approved, you can proceed with fund transfer
- If rejected, you don't participate in this drawdown
- Other lenders make their own decisions independently
- Borrower can see which lenders approved
- Fund transfer process proceeds for approved lenders

Understanding lender approval and rejection helps you make informed decisions on drawdowns and participate effectively in credit facilities.
