# Token Generation and Issuance

## Overview

Token generation and issuance is the process of creating tokens for funding notices. These tokens represent the drawdown amounts and enable tracking, distribution, and management of funds across multiple lenders. Tokens serve as digital representations of the drawdown that facilitate the fund transfer process.

## What This Means for the User

When tokens are generated for a funding notice:

- **Digital Representation**: Tokens represent the drawdown amount digitally, enabling tracking and management.

- **Lender Distribution**: Tokens are distributed to lenders based on their participation percentages in the facility, so each lender knows their portion.

- **Enables Tracking**: Token allocation allows tracking of which lenders have approved, rejected, or confirmed transfers.

- **Facilitates Transfer**: Tokens enable the fund transfer process by clearly defining each lender's contribution.

- **Provides Transparency**: Token distribution makes it clear how the drawdown amount is allocated across lenders.

Understanding tokens helps you navigate the drawdown process and understand how funds are distributed.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Token Generation Process

Tokens are generated by facility agents:

- **Initiation**: Facility agents initiate token generation for approved funding requests.

- **Token Creation**: Tokens are created for the borrower, representing the total drawdown amount from the funding request.

- **Distribution Setup**: Token distribution is configured, specifying how much each lender will receive based on their participation percentages.

- **Status Update**: Funding notice status updates to show that tokens have been generated.

### Token Distribution to Lenders

Tokens are distributed based on lender commitments:

- **Participation Percentages**: Each lender's allocation is calculated based on their participation percentage in the facility.

- **Individual Allocations**: Each lender receives their allocated portion of tokens, clearly showing their contribution amount.

- **Distribution Tracking**: The system tracks token distribution, showing which lenders have received their allocations.

- **Lender Visibility**: After borrower approval, lenders can see their token allocations in the funding notice.

### Borrower Token Approval

Borrowers must approve token transfer:

- **Review Allocation**: Borrowers review the token allocation to verify amounts and distribution are correct.

- **Verify Distribution**: Check that lender allocations match expectations and facility participation percentages.

- **Approve Transfer**: Once verified, borrowers approve the token transfer, making the funding notice visible to lenders.

- **Enables Next Steps**: Approval enables lenders to review and approve their participation in the drawdown.

### Token Status Tracking

Token status is tracked throughout the process:

- **Generated**: Tokens have been created and distributed.

- **Borrower Approved**: Borrower has approved token transfer.

- **Lender Review**: Lenders are reviewing and making decisions.

- **Transfer Confirmed**: Lenders have confirmed fund transfers.

## Important Points to Know

- Tokens are created when facility agents initiate generation - facility agents control when tokens are generated for approved funding requests.

- Token amounts match the funding request amount - the total token amount equals the drawdown amount from the funding request.

- Distribution is based on lender commitments - each lender's allocation is calculated from their participation percentage in the facility.

- Borrower must approve tokens before lenders can see notice - lenders cannot view funding notices until borrowers approve token transfer.

- Each lender receives their allocated portion - token distribution clearly shows each lender's contribution amount.

- Tokens enable individual lender tracking - each lender's approval and transfer status can be tracked separately.

- Token approval is required - borrowers must approve token transfer for the process to continue.

- Distribution percentages are calculated automatically - the system calculates lender allocations based on facility configuration.

- Tokens represent the drawdown digitally - they serve as digital representations that facilitate the fund transfer process.

- Complete transparency - token distribution makes it clear how funds are allocated across all lenders.

Understanding token generation and issuance helps you navigate the token-based drawdown process, understand how funds are distributed to lenders, and complete funding from credit facilities efficiently.
