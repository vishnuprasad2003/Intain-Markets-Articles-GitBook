# Token Generation and Issuance

## Overview

Token generation and issuance is the process of creating tokens for funding notices. These tokens represent the drawdown amounts and enable tracking and distribution to lenders.

## Who Can Use This

- Facility Agents who generate tokens
- Borrowers who receive tokens
- Lenders who receive token allocations

## When This Is Used

Use token generation when:
- Funding request has been approved
- Funding notice needs tokens generated
- You want to understand how tokens work
- You need to track token distribution

## Step-by-Step Process

### Token Generation

1. **Initiate Generation**
   - Facility agent initiates token generation
   - Specifies token distribution to lenders
   - Confirms allocation amounts

2. **Tokens Created**
   - Tokens are created for the borrower
   - Token distribution is set up
   - Each lender's allocation is specified
   - Status updates to show tokens generated

3. **Token Distribution**
   - Tokens are allocated to each lender
   - Allocation based on lender commitments
   - Distribution percentages calculated
   - Individual lender amounts determined

### Borrower Approval

1. **Review Allocation**
   - Borrower reviews token allocation
   - Verifies amounts are correct
   - Checks distribution percentages

2. **Approve Transfer**
   - Borrower approves token transfer
   - Enables funding notice visibility to lenders
   - Status updates to show approval

## Rules & Validations

- Tokens are created when facility agent initiates generation
- Token amounts match the funding request amount
- Distribution is based on lender commitments
- Borrower must approve tokens before lenders can see notice
- Each lender receives their allocated portion

## What Happens Next

After token generation:
- Tokens are created and allocated to lenders
- Borrower reviews and approves token transfer
- Funding notice becomes visible to lenders
- Lenders can review and approve drawdowns
- Fund transfer process can proceed

Understanding token generation and issuance helps you navigate the token-based drawdown process and complete funding from credit facilities.
