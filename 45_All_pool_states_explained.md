### Pool Status Flow

1. **Created**

   - Recipients can view and analyze
   - You can continue adding loans
   - Pool metrics update as loans change

3. **Mandate Pending**

   - Market maker is reviewing
   - Waiting for market maker decision
   - Limited editing available

4. **Deal**
   - Market maker has accepted mandate

## Rules & Validations

- You can edit pools while they're in Created or Preview status
- Once a pool reaches Deal status, editing is restricted

- You cannot easily revert from Deal status back to earlier statuses
- Market maker rejection may return pool to Preview status
