# Pool Mandate Review

## Overview

Pool mandate review is the process where market makers review pools shared with them and decide whether to accept mandates to structure and manage those pools. This guide covers how market makers evaluate pools and make mandate decisions.

## Who Can Use This

- Market Makers who receive pool mandates

## When This Is Used

Use pool mandate review when:
- You receive a pool mandate from an issuer

- You're reviewing pools for structuring

## Step-by-Step Process

   - Open pool details
   - Review pool information

2. **Analyze Pool**

### Making Mandate Decisions

1. **Accept Mandate**

## Rules & Validations

## What Happens Next

After making a mandate decision:

- Issuer is notified of your decision

Understanding pool mandate review helps market makers effectively evaluate pool opportunities and make informed mandate decisions.
