# Pool Mandate Review

## Overview

Pool mandate review is the process where market makers review pools shared with them and decide whether to accept mandates to structure and manage those pools. This guide covers how market makers evaluate pools, assess opportunities, and make informed mandate decisions that affect pool workflow progression.

## Who Can Use This

- Market Makers who receive pool mandates from issuers

## When This Is Used

### Making Mandate Decisions

   - Confirm acceptance
   - Pool status updates to "Deal" or similar

2. **Reject Mandate**
   - Review pool and identify concerns
   - Decide not to accept the mandate
   - Click "Reject Mandate" button or similar
   - Provide rejection reason if required
   - Enter comments explaining your decision
   - Confirm rejection
   - Pool may return to "Preview" status
   - Issuer can share with other market makers

3. **Request Changes**
   - Identify needed improvements
   - Provide feedback to issuer
   - Request specific changes or modifications
   - Enter change request details
   - Submit change request
   - Wait for issuer to update pool
   - Review updated pool and decide again

## Rules & Validations

- You can accept or reject mandates based on your evaluation - make decisions based on your assessment of pool quality and marketability.

- You can request changes if improvements are needed - provide feedback to help issuers improve pools before acceptance.

- Acceptance makes you the market maker for the pool - once accepted, you're committed to structuring the deal.

- Rejection allows issuer to share with other market makers - rejection doesn't prevent issuer from finding another market maker.

- Your decision affects pool workflow progression - acceptance moves pool toward deal status, rejection may return it to preview.

- Mandate decisions are tracked - all decisions are recorded with timestamps and reasons.

- You can only accept one mandate per pool - once accepted, pool is committed to you.

- Status controls what actions are available - pool status determines what you can do.

- Complete audit trail - all mandate decisions are recorded for audit purposes.

- Issuer is notified of your decision - issuers receive notifications when you make decisions.

## What Happens Next

After making a mandate decision:
- **If Accepted**: You become the market maker and can structure the deal, pool moves to "Deal" status, you proceed with deal structuring activities, and pool progresses toward completion.

- **If Rejected**: Pool may return to "Preview" status, issuer receives notification with reason, issuer can share with other market makers, and pool remains available for other opportunities.

- **If Changes Requested**: Issuer receives your feedback, issuer can update pool based on feedback, issuer may resubmit for your review, and process can repeat until accepted or rejected.

After accepting mandate:
- Pool is committed to you for structuring
- You proceed with deal structuring activities
- Pool moves toward final deal completion
- You coordinate with issuer and investors
- Deal progresses through structuring to completion

Understanding pool mandate review helps market makers effectively evaluate pool opportunities, make informed mandate decisions, and structure deals that meet market requirements and investor expectations.
