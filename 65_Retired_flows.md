# Retired Flows

## Overview

This document tracks workflows, processes, and features that have been retired or deprecated. Understanding retired flows helps you know what's no longer available, what replaced old workflows, and how to use current features effectively.

## What This Means for the User

When flows are retired:

- **No Longer Available**: Retired features are no longer available in the platform.

- **Replaced by Better Methods**: Old workflows are typically replaced by improved processes.

- **Migration Needed**: You may need to migrate from old methods to new ones.

- **Current Features**: Focus on using current features that replace retired ones.

- **Documentation Updated**: Documentation reflects current features, not retired ones.

Understanding retired flows helps you use current platform features effectively and avoid trying to use features that no longer exist.
