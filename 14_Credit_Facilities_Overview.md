# Credit Facilities Overview

## Overview

A credit facility is a lending arrangement where a borrower can draw down funds as needed, up to a pre-approved limit. Think of it like a line of credit - you get approved for a maximum amount, and you can borrow portions of it when you need them, rather than receiving all funds at once. Credit facilities provide flexibility for borrowers while giving lenders control over fund disbursement.

## What This Means for the User

Credit facilities work differently from traditional loans:

- **Pre-Approved Limit**: You get approved for a maximum borrowing amount upfront, but you don't receive all funds immediately.

- **Flexible Drawdowns**: You can request specific amounts as needed, up to your approved limit. Each drawdown is a separate funding request that must be reviewed and approved.

- **Multiple Drawdowns**: You can make multiple drawdowns over time, as long as you stay within your approved limit and available borrowing capacity.

- **Structured Process**: Each drawdown goes through a review and approval process, ensuring compliance with facility rules and proper documentation.

- **Ongoing Management**: The facility remains active, allowing you to manage multiple drawdowns and track your borrowing over time.

This structure provides flexibility for borrowers while maintaining proper oversight and control for lenders and facility agents.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Term Sheets

Term sheets are the initial proposals that borrowers create to request a credit facility. They outline key terms like the maximum facility amount, interest rates, repayment terms, and other conditions. Term sheets must be signed electronically and submitted to facility agents for review. Once approved, a master commitment is automatically created.

### Master Commitments

Master commitments are the finalized credit facility agreements that define the complete facility structure. They're automatically created when term sheets are approved and contain all the rules, parameters, lender information, and borrowing base calculations needed to operate the facility. Facility agents configure master commitments, and lenders must approve them before facilities become active.

### Funding Requests

Funding requests are specific requests to draw down funds from an active facility. Borrowers create funding requests when they need funds, specifying the amount, purpose, and providing supporting documentation. Each request must be reviewed and approved by the facility agent before funds can be disbursed.

### Funding Notices

Funding notices are automatically generated when funding requests are approved. They document the approved drawdown and are sent to lenders for review and approval. Lenders review funding notices and approve or reject individual drawdowns.

### Facility Status

Facilities progress through statuses from creation to activation:
- **Draft**: Term sheet or master commitment is being prepared
- **Under Review**: Waiting for facility agent or lender review
- **Active**: Facility is operational and borrowers can create funding requests
- **Pending Approval**: Waiting for lender approval

### Roles in Credit Facilities

Three main parties participate:
- **Borrowers**: Create term sheets and funding requests, approve token transfers
- **Facility Agents**: Review term sheets, configure master commitments, review funding requests, sign funding notices
- **Lenders**: Approve master commitments and funding notices, provide capital
