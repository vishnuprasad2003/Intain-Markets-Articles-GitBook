# Credit Facilities Overview

## Overview

A credit facility is a lending arrangement where a borrower can draw down funds as needed, up to a pre-approved limit. Think of it like a line of credit - you get approved for a maximum amount, and you can borrow portions of it when you need them.

## Who Can Use This

- Borrowers who need flexible funding
- Facility Agents who structure and manage facilities
- Lenders who provide capital

## When This Is Used

Use credit facilities when you:
- Need flexible funding that you can draw down as needed
- Want a pre-approved borrowing limit
- Need to manage multiple drawdowns over time
- Want to work with multiple lenders

## Step-by-Step Process

### Complete Credit Facility Workflow

1. **Create Term Sheet**
   - Borrower creates term sheet with facility terms
   - Signs via electronic signature
   - Submits for facility agent review

2. **Facility Agent Reviews**
   - Facility agent reviews term sheet
   - Approves or requests changes
   - If approved, master commitment is automatically created

3. **Configure Master Commitment**
   - Facility agent sets up facility rules
   - Adds lenders and configures their participation
   - Sets up borrowing base calculations
   - Submits for lender approval

4. **Lender Approves**
   - Lenders review master commitment
   - Any lender approval activates the facility
   - Facility becomes active and operational

5. **Create Funding Requests**
   - Borrower creates funding requests as needed
   - Specifies amount and purpose
   - Submits for facility agent review

6. **Facility Agent Reviews Requests**
   - Facility agent reviews for compliance
   - Approves or requests changes
   - If approved, funding notice is automatically generated

7. **Complete Funding**
   - Tokens are generated and distributed
   - Facility agent signs for lenders
   - Borrower approves token transfer
   - Lenders review and approve drawdowns
   - Funds are transferred

## Rules & Validations

- Term sheets must be approved before master commitments are created
- Master commitments must be approved by lenders before becoming active
- Funding requests can only be created against active facilities
- Approved funding requests automatically generate funding notices
- Each drawdown requires lender approval

## What Happens Next

After creating a credit facility:
- You have a pre-approved borrowing limit
- You can create funding requests as needed
- Each request goes through review and approval
- Drawdowns are documented and tracked
- You can manage multiple drawdowns over time

Understanding credit facilities helps you effectively use this powerful tool for flexible, managed borrowing with multiple lenders.
