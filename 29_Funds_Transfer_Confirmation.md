# Funds Transfer Confirmation

## Overview

Funds transfer confirmation is the final step where lenders confirm that they have transferred funds to the borrower. This completes the drawdown process for each individual lender and provides official confirmation that funds have been disbursed. Each lender confirms their transfer independently, allowing for flexible timing and individual tracking.

## Who Can Use This
