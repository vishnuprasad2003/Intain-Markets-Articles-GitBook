# Token Approval

## Overview

Token approval is the step where borrowers approve the transfer of tokens, making funding notices visible to lenders. This guide covers how to review token allocations, verify distribution accuracy, and approve token transfers to enable the drawdown process and allow lenders to review and approve funding.

## Who Can Use This

- Borrowers who have funding notices with generated tokens

## When This Is Used

## Rules & Validations

- You can only approve tokens after they've been generated - tokens must be created by facility agent before you can approve.

- You must review allocation before approving - take time to verify token amounts and distribution are correct.

- Approval makes funding notice visible to lenders - once approved, lenders can see and review the notice.

- Once approved, you cannot easily undo the approval - approval is a significant step, so verify everything before approving.

- Lenders can then review and approve drawdowns - after your approval, lenders make their own decisions.

- Token amounts must match funding request - the total token amount should equal your approved funding request amount.

- Lender distribution is based on facility participation - allocations are calculated from lender participation percentages.

- Approval is required for process to continue - the drawdown process cannot proceed until you approve token transfer.

- Status updates after approval - funding notice status changes to reflect your approval.

- Complete audit trail - your approval is recorded with timestamp and details.

## What Happens Next
