# Deal Setup and Calculations

## Overview

Deal setup and calculations involve configuring the financial modeling, borrowing base calculations, and facility parameters that determine how the credit facility operates. This guide covers how facility agents set up these calculations.

## Who Can Use This

- Facility Agents who configure facility calculations

## When This Is Used

Use deal setup and calculations when:
- You're configuring a master commitment
- You need to set up borrowing base calculations
- You want to define facility parameters
- You're setting up financial modeling

## Step-by-Step Process

### Setting Up Borrowing Base Calculations

1. **Configure Calculation Method**
   - Navigate to Borrowing Base section
   - Select calculation method
   - Define how borrowing base is calculated
   - Set calculation parameters

2. **Define Collateral Eligibility**
   - Set what collateral qualifies
   - Define collateral quality requirements
   - Set age and geographic limits
   - Configure other eligibility criteria

3. **Set Advance Rates**
   - Set advance rate per collateral type
   - Configure rate adjustments
   - Set maximum and minimum limits
   - Save rate configuration

### Configuring Facility Parameters

1. **Set Financial Parameters**
   - Configure interest rate structure
   - Set fee calculations
   - Define payment terms
   - Set drawdown limits

2. **Configure Utilization**
   - Set up utilization calculations
   - Define available capacity tracking
   - Configure utilization percentage
   - Set up capacity monitoring

## Rules & Validations

- Borrowing base calculations must be configured
- Collateral eligibility rules must be defined
- Advance rates must be set for each collateral type
- Facility parameters must be complete
- Calculations must be validated before submission

## What Happens Next

After setting up calculations:
- Facility is ready for lender approval
- Borrowing base determines available capacity
- Facility parameters control operations
- Calculations are used for funding request reviews
- Facility becomes operational when approved

Understanding deal setup and calculations helps facility agents effectively configure credit facilities and ensure proper operation.
