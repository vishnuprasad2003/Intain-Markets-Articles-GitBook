# Funding Notices Overview

## Overview

A funding notice is the official documentation for each drawdown from a credit facility. It's automatically generated when a funding request is approved by the facility agent and contains all the details needed for the drawdown, including token distribution to lenders, drawdown amounts, and fund transfer instructions. Funding notices serve as the bridge between approved funding requests and actual fund disbursement.

## What This Means for the User

When your funding request is approved, a funding notice is automatically created for you. This funding notice:

- **Documents the Drawdown**: Contains all details about the approved drawdown, including amount, purpose, funding date, and other information.

- **Distributes Tokens**: Tokens are generated and distributed to lenders based on their participation percentages in the facility.

- **Tracks Lender Participation**: Each lender's approval status and fund transfer confirmation are tracked individually.

- **Enables Fund Transfer**: Once lenders approve and confirm transfers, funds are disbursed to you.

- **Provides Complete Documentation**: Serves as official documentation of the drawdown for audit and record-keeping purposes.

Funding notices make the drawdown process transparent, trackable, and properly documented.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Automatic Creation

Funding notices are automatically created when funding requests are approved:

- **Trigger**: When facility agent approves a funding request, the system automatically creates a funding notice.

- **Pre-populated Data**: The funding notice is pre-populated with information from the approved funding request, including amount, purpose, funding date, and facility details.

- **Linked to Request**: The funding notice is linked to the original funding request, maintaining a complete audit trail.

- **Ready for Processing**: The funding notice is ready for token generation and distribution.

### Token Generation and Distribution

Tokens represent the drawdown amounts and enable tracking:

- **Token Creation**: Facility agents generate tokens for the borrower, representing the total drawdown amount.

- **Lender Distribution**: Tokens are distributed to lenders based on their participation percentages in the facility. Each lender receives their allocated portion.

- **Individual Tracking**: Each lender's token allocation and status are tracked separately, allowing for individual lender decisions.

- **Borrower Approval Required**: Borrowers must approve token transfer before lenders can see the funding notice.

### Borrower Token Approval

Borrowers must approve token transfer:

- **Review Allocation**: Borrowers review token allocation and distribution to ensure accuracy.

- **Approve Transfer**: Once approved, the funding notice becomes visible to lenders, and the drawdown process can proceed.

- **Enables Lender Review**: After borrower approval, lenders can review and approve or reject their participation.

### Lender Review and Approval

Lenders review funding notices individually:

- **Individual Decisions**: Each lender makes their own decision to approve or reject participation in the drawdown.

- **Independent Tracking**: Each lender's decision is tracked separately, so one lender's decision doesn't affect others.

- **Approval Enables Transfer**: Approved lenders can proceed with fund transfer, while rejected lenders don't participate.

### Fund Transfer Confirmation

Lenders confirm fund transfers:

- **Transfer Funds**: Lenders transfer their allocated portion to the borrower.

- **Confirm Transfer**: Lenders confirm that funds have been transferred, marking their participation as complete.

- **Individual Confirmation**: Each lender confirms independently, and the system tracks each confirmation separately.

## Important Points to Know

- Funding notices are automatically created - you don't need to create them manually when funding requests are approved.

- Tokens must be generated before borrower approval - facility agents generate tokens, and then borrowers approve the transfer.

- Borrower approval makes notices visible to lenders - lenders cannot see funding notices until borrowers approve token transfer.

- Each lender makes independent decisions - one lender's approval or rejection doesn't affect other lenders.

- Fund transfers are confirmed individually - each lender confirms their own transfer separately.

- Complete audit trail - all actions, approvals, and confirmations are recorded with who did what and when.

- Status tracks progress - funding notice status shows where it is in the process (token generation, borrower approval, lender review, fund transfer).

- Linked to funding request - funding notices maintain connection to original funding requests for complete documentation.

- Official documentation - funding notices serve as official records of drawdowns for audit and compliance purposes.

- Multiple lenders supported - facilities can have multiple lenders, and each participates independently in drawdowns.

Understanding funding notices helps you navigate the drawdown process, track lender participation, and complete funding from your credit facilities efficiently and transparently.
