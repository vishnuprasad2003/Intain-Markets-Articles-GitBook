# Funding Notices Overview

## Overview

A funding notice is the official documentation for each drawdown from a credit facility. It's automatically generated when a funding request is approved and contains all the details needed for the drawdown, including token distribution to lenders.

## Who Can Use This

- Borrowers who receive funding notices
- Facility Agents who manage funding notices
- Lenders who review funding notices

## When This Is Used

Use funding notices when:
- Your funding request has been approved
- You need to complete the drawdown process
- You want to understand how drawdowns are documented
- You need to review drawdown details

## Step-by-Step Process
