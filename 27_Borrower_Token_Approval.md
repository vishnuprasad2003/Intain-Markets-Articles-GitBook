# Borrower Token Approval

## Overview

Borrower token approval is the step where the borrower approves the transfer of tokens, making the funding notice visible to lenders and enabling the drawdown process to proceed. This approval step ensures borrowers verify token allocation before lenders can review and approve drawdowns.

## Who Can Use This

- Borrowers who have funding notices with generated tokens

## When This Is Used

Use token approval when:
