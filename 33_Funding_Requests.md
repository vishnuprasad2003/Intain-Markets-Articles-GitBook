## Rules & Validations

- You can only create requests against active facilities - facilities must be approved by lenders and in Active status.

- Facility must have available borrowing capacity - you can only request amounts up to your available capacity, which may be less than your total facility limit.

- You can have only one draft request per facility at a time - you must submit or delete draft requests before creating new ones.

- Approved requests automatically generate funding notices - you don't need to create notices manually.

- Rejected requests cannot be resubmitted - if rejected, you must create a new request addressing the issues.

- Change requests allow editing and resubmission - this is less severe than rejection and allows iterative improvement.

- Request amount cannot exceed available capacity - system validates that amount is within limits.

- Required documentation must be provided - missing documents may result in rejection or change request.

- Status controls what actions are available - you can only edit draft requests or requests with changes requested.

- Complete audit trail - all requests, submissions, and outcomes are recorded with timestamps and details.

## What Happens Next

After creating a funding request:
- Request is saved as draft or submitted for review
- If submitted, facility agent receives notification
- Facility agent evaluates and makes decision
- You receive notification of outcome

After facility agent approval:
- Funding notice is automatically created
- Tokens are generated and distributed
- You approve token transfer
- Funding notice becomes visible to lenders
- Lenders review and approve drawdowns
- Funds are transferred as lenders confirm

After rejection:
- You receive rejection reason
- You can create new request addressing issues
- New request goes through same review process
- You can adjust amount or provide better documentation

Understanding funding requests helps you effectively request drawdowns from your credit facilities, provide proper documentation, manage request status, and work through the approval process to access funds when needed.
