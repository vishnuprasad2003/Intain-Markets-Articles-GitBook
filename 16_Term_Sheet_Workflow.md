# Term Sheet Workflow

Understanding the term sheet workflow helps you navigate this critical first phase from creation through approval.

## Who Can Use This

- Approved term sheets automatically create master commitments. You don't need to create master commitments manually.

- Rejected term sheets cannot be resubmitted. If rejected, you must create a new term sheet.

- Change requests allow iterative improvement. You can go through multiple rounds of changes until approved or rejected.

- Electronic signatures are legally binding. Once signed, term sheets represent formal proposals.

After term sheet approval:
