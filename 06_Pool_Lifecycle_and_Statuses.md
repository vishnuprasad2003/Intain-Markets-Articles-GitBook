# Pool Lifecycle and Statuses

## Overview

Pools go through several stages from creation to final deal completion. Each status represents a specific stage in the pool's journey and determines what actions are available.

## Who Can Use This

- Issuers who create and manage pools
- Market Makers who review and structure pools
- Investors who review pools
- Other parties involved in pool transactions

## When This Is Used

Understanding pool lifecycle helps when:
- You need to know what actions are available at each stage
- You want to track where your pool is in the process
- You need to understand why certain actions are disabled
- You want to plan your workflow

## Step-by-Step Process

### Pool Status Flow

1. **Created Status**
   - Pool is created with basic information
   - You can add loans, edit information, and configure sharing
   - Pool is visible only to you

2. **Preview Status**
   - Pool is shared with other parties for review
   - Recipients can view and analyze the pool
   - You can continue adding or removing loans
   - Pool metrics update as loans change

3. **Mandate Pending Status**
   - Pool has been submitted to a market maker
   - Market maker is reviewing and deciding whether to accept
   - You wait for the market maker's decision
   - Limited editing is available

4. **Deal Status**
   - Market maker has accepted the mandate
   - Pool is finalized and structured
   - Transaction is committed
   - Editing is restricted

### Status Transitions

1. **Moving to Preview**
   - Share the pool with other organizations
   - Recipients can now view the pool
   - Status may show as Preview in the interface

2. **Moving to Mandate Pending**
   - Submit pool to market maker for mandate review
   - Market maker sees the pool and reviews it
   - Status changes to reflect mandate review

3. **Moving to Deal**
   - Market maker accepts the mandate
   - Pool is finalized and structured
   - Status changes to Deal

## Rules & Validations

- You can edit pools while they're in Created or Preview status
- Once a pool reaches Deal status, editing is restricted
- Status changes are recorded with who changed it and when
- You cannot easily revert from Deal status back to earlier statuses
- Market maker rejection may return pool to Preview status

## What Happens Next

After understanding pool lifecycle:
- You know what actions are available at each status
- You can plan your workflow based on status progression
- You understand why certain actions are disabled
- You can track your pool's progress through the stages
- You know what to expect at each stage

Understanding pool lifecycle helps you navigate the platform effectively and know what to expect at each stage of your pool's journey from creation to deal completion.
