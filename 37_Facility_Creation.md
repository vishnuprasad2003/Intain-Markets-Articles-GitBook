## Rules & Validations

- You must complete all required fields before submission - incomplete configurations cannot be submitted.

- At least one lender must be configured - facilities require at least one lender to proceed.

- Facility rules must be complete - all rules, calculations, and parameters must be configured.

- Validation must pass before submission - system validates configuration before allowing submission.

- Once submitted, editing is restricted - make sure configuration is correct before submission.

- Setup status must show "Completed" - you cannot submit until setup is complete.

- Master commitment is pre-populated - term sheet data is automatically transferred, so you don't need to re-enter it.

- You can save multiple times - save your progress as you configure, status remains "Draft" until submission.

- Status controls actions - you can only edit while status is "Draft".

- Complete audit trail - all configuration changes are recorded with timestamps.

## What Happens Next

After configuring master commitment:
- You submit for lender approval
- Status changes to "Pending Lender Approval"
- Lenders receive notifications
- Lenders review master commitment
- Any lender approval activates the facility
- Facility becomes active when approved
- Borrowers can create funding requests

After lender approval:
- Facility status changes to "Active"
- Facility is operational and ready for use
- Borrowers can create funding requests
- Facility agent can manage active facility
- Drawdowns can begin

Understanding facility creation helps facility agents effectively configure master commitments, set up complete facility structures, and prepare facilities for lender approval and activation.
