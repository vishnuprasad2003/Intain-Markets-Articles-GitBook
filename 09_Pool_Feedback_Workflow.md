# Pool Feedback Workflow

## Overview

The feedback workflow allows market makers, investors, and other parties to provide input on pools shared with them. This collaborative process helps improve pool quality, ensures all parties are aligned before finalizing deals, and enables effective communication between issuers and reviewers. Feedback can be provided at both pool-level and loan-level, allowing for detailed and specific input.

## Who Can Use This

- Market Makers who review pools and want to request changes or provide comments
- Investors who review opportunities and have questions or concerns
- Rating Agencies who analyze pools and need to communicate findings
- Issuers who receive feedback and need to respond and make changes

## When This Is Used

Use feedback workflow when:
- Reviewers want to request changes or provide comments on pools
- Issuers need to address feedback and improve pools based on input
- Parties want to discuss pool details or ask questions
- Change requests need to be communicated formally
- Issues or concerns need to be flagged for attention
- Clarifications are needed about pool characteristics or loan data

## Step-by-Step Process

### Providing Feedback

1. **Review the Pool**
   - Navigate to the shared pool in your view
   - View pool details, metrics, and loan characteristics
   - Analyze loan data and pool composition
   - Identify areas needing attention or improvement
   - Review pool information thoroughly before providing feedback

2. **Decide Feedback Type and Level**
   - **General Feedback**: Comments, questions, or observations about the pool
   - **Change Request**: Formal request for modifications that need to be addressed
   - **Pool-Level Feedback**: Feedback about the pool overall (metrics, composition, structure)
   - **Loan-Level Feedback**: Feedback about specific loans (data issues, eligibility, characteristics)
   - Choose the appropriate type and level for your feedback

3. **Access Feedback Function**
   - Navigate to the pool's feedback section
   - Click to add new feedback
   - Select whether this is pool-level or loan-level feedback
   - If loan-level, select the specific loan(s) you're providing feedback on

4. **Enter Feedback Details**
   - Type your feedback message clearly and specifically
   - Specify if this is a change request (requires action) or general feedback (informational)
   - Provide context and explanation for your feedback
   - Be specific about what needs to change or what your concern is
   - Include any relevant details that help the issuer understand your feedback

5. **Submit Feedback**
   - Review your feedback message
   - Confirm the feedback type and level
   - Submit the feedback
   - Issuer receives notification about the feedback
   - Feedback is recorded and tracked

6. **Track Feedback Status**
   - View your submitted feedback
   - See if issuer has viewed or responded to it
   - Monitor whether changes have been made based on your feedback
   - Follow up if needed

### Responding to Feedback (Issuers)

1. **Review All Feedback**
   - Check your dashboard for pools with unread feedback
   - Navigate to pools with feedback notifications
   - Review all feedback messages carefully
   - Check change requests first (these require action)
   - Read comments and questions
   - Note any flagged items or concerns

2. **Prioritize Actions**
   - Address critical issues first (blocking problems, data errors)
   - Handle change requests that prevent pool progression
   - Then address other feedback and questions
   - Create a plan for addressing all feedback

3. **Make Necessary Changes**
   - Update pool information if needed
   - Fix identified data issues
   - Address loan-level concerns (remove loans, correct data, etc.)
   - Update pool metrics if loans are added or removed
   - Resolve flagged items
   - Make all changes requested in change requests

4. **Communicate Your Response**
   - Respond to feedback messages with your actions
   - Explain changes you made
   - Answer questions that were asked
   - Ask for clarification if feedback is unclear
   - Confirm when you've completed requested changes
   - Provide updates on your progress

5. **Mark Feedback as Addressed**
   - Indicate when you've addressed feedback
   - Mark change requests as completed after making changes
   - Update feedback status to show it's been handled
   - Notify reviewers that changes have been made

6. **Resubmit if Needed**
   - When changes are complete, resubmit the pool for review
   - Status may update to reflect resubmission
   - Reviewers are notified of changes
   - Reviewers can review changes and provide additional feedback if needed

### Managing Feedback History

1. **View Feedback History**
   - Access the pool's feedback section
   - See all feedback messages in chronological order
   - View who provided feedback and when
   - See feedback status (unread, read, addressed)

2. **Filter and Search Feedback**
   - Filter by feedback type (change request vs. general feedback)
   - Filter by level (pool-level vs. loan-level)
   - Search for specific feedback messages
   - View feedback from specific reviewers

3. **Track Feedback Resolution**
   - See which feedback has been addressed
   - Track which change requests are completed
   - Monitor outstanding feedback that needs attention
   - Ensure all critical feedback is resolved

## Rules & Validations

- You can only provide feedback if sharing permissions allow it. Some pools may have view-only access, preventing feedback.

- Change requests require issuers to make changes and resubmit. Change requests are more formal than general feedback and require action.

- Feedback can be pool-level or loan-level. Pool-level feedback is about the pool overall, while loan-level feedback is about specific loans.

- Unread feedback is tracked and highlighted. Issuers see notifications and counts of unread feedback.

- Issuers can respond to feedback by making changes or adding comments. You can address feedback through actions or communication.

- Feedback is permanent and recorded. All feedback is stored in the audit trail with who provided it and when.

- Multiple reviewers can provide feedback. Different parties can provide feedback on the same pool.

- Feedback can be provided at any time while pool is shared. As long as the pool is shared and in an appropriate status, feedback can be provided.

- Loan-level feedback requires selecting specific loans. You must identify which loan(s) your feedback relates to.

- Feedback notifications are sent automatically. Issuers receive notifications when feedback is provided.

## What Happens Next

After providing feedback:
- Issuers receive notifications about the feedback
- Feedback appears in the pool's feedback section
- Unread feedback is highlighted for issuers
- Change requests require pool updates and resubmission
- General feedback can be addressed through discussion or changes
- Feedback history is maintained for audit purposes

After responding to feedback:
- Reviewers can see your responses and changes
- Change requests are marked as addressed when changes are made
- Pool may be resubmitted for review
- Reviewers can provide additional feedback if needed
- Pool quality improves through iterative feedback and changes

After resolving feedback:
- All parties can see that feedback has been addressed
- Change requests are marked as completed
- Pool can progress to next stages
- Feedback history shows the complete conversation
- Pool is improved based on collaborative input

The feedback workflow enables effective collaboration, helping improve pool quality through constructive input and ensuring all parties are aligned before finalizing deals. This iterative process helps catch issues early and ensures pools meet all requirements before commitment.
