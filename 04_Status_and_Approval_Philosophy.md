# Status and Approval Philosophy

## Overview

Statuses represent where items are in their workflow. Approvals ensure quality and compliance before items proceed. Understanding statuses and approvals helps you know what actions are available and what needs to happen next.

## Who Can Use This

- All platform users

## When This Is Used

Understanding statuses and approvals helps when:
- You need to know what actions are available
- You want to understand why actions are disabled
- You need to track workflow progression
- You want to understand approval requirements

## Step-by-Step Process

### Understanding Statuses

1. **Check Current Status**
   - View the status badge on any item
   - Status shows where the item is in its workflow
   - Different statuses allow different actions

2. **Understand Status Meaning**
   - Draft means the item is being prepared
   - Under Review means it's waiting for review
   - Approved means it can proceed
   - Rejected means it's stopped

3. **See Status History**
   - View who changed the status and when
   - See the complete progression of status changes
   - Understand how the item reached its current state

### Understanding Approvals

1. **Identify Approval Requirements**
   - Some items require approval before proceeding
   - Different roles can approve different items
   - Approvals act as gates in the workflow

2. **Submit for Approval**
   - Complete all required information
   - Submit the item for review
   - Status changes to indicate it's under review

3. **Review and Approve**
   - Reviewers see items requiring their approval
   - They can approve, reject, or request changes
   - Status updates based on their decision

## Rules & Validations

- Status controls what actions are available
- You can only take actions allowed by the current status
- Approvals must happen in the correct order
- Some approvals require specific roles
- Rejection usually stops the workflow
- Change requests allow items to be edited and resubmitted

## What Happens Next

After understanding statuses and approvals:
- You know what actions are available based on status
- You understand why some actions are disabled
- You know what approvals are needed before proceeding
- You can track workflow progression through status changes
- You understand the approval process for your role

Statuses guide you through workflows, ensuring proper order and approvals. When actions are disabled, the platform usually shows a reason, helping you understand what needs to happen next.
