# Deal Setup & Calculations

## Overview

Deal setup and calculations involve configuring the financial modeling, borrowing base calculations, and facility parameters that determine how the credit facility operates. This guide covers how facility agents set up these calculations.

## Borrowing Base Calculations

### What is Borrowing Base?

Definition:
- Maximum amount borrower can draw
- Calculated based on eligible collateral
- Updated as collateral changes
- Determines available capacity
- Core facility parameter

### Setting Up Calculations

**What to configure:**
- Calculation method
- Collateral eligibility criteria
- Advance rates for different collateral types
- Concentration limits
- Valuation methods

**How to configure:**
1. Navigate to Borrowing Base section
2. Select calculation method
3. Define collateral types
4. Set advance rates
5. Configure limits and constraints

## Collateral Eligibility Rules

### Defining Eligibility

**What to define:**
- What collateral qualifies
- Collateral quality requirements
- Collateral age limits
- Geographic restrictions
- Other eligibility criteria

**How to define:**
1. Go to Collateral Rules section
2. Set eligibility criteria
3. Define quality requirements
4. Set age and geographic limits
5. Configure other restrictions

### Advance Rates

**What to set:**
- Advance rate per collateral type
- Maximum advance rates
- Minimum advance rates
- Rate adjustments
- Other rate parameters

**How to set:**
1. Navigate to Advance Rates section
2. Set rates for each collateral type
3. Configure rate adjustments
4. Set maximum and minimum limits
5. Save rate configuration

## Facility Modeling

### Financial Parameters

**What to model:**
- Interest rate structure
- Fee calculations
- Payment terms
- Drawdown limits
- Other financial parameters

**How to model:**
1. Go to Financial Modeling section
2. Configure interest rates
3. Set fee structures
4. Define payment terms
5. Set drawdown limits

### Utilization Calculations

**What to calculate:**
- Current utilization
- Available capacity
- Utilization percentage
- Impact of drawdowns
- Remaining capacity

**How it works:**
- System calculates automatically
- Updates with each drawdown
- Shows current utilization
- Tracks available capacity
- Updates in real-time

## Deal Structure Configuration

### Facility Structure

**What to configure:**
- Facility type and structure
- Drawdown mechanisms
- Payment structures
- Reporting requirements
- Other structural elements

**How to configure:**
1. Navigate to Facility Structure section
2. Set facility type
3. Configure drawdown mechanisms
4. Set payment structures
5. Define reporting requirements

### Lender Participation

**What to configure:**
- Lender commitment amounts
- Participation percentages
- Voting rights
- Lender-specific terms
- Other participation parameters

**How to configure:**
1. Go to Lender Groups section
2. Set commitment amounts
3. Configure participation percentages
4. Set voting rights
5. Define lender terms

## Calculation Validation

### Validating Setup

**What to validate:**
- Calculation methods correct
- Rates and limits appropriate
- Eligibility rules complete
- Configuration consistent
- No calculation errors

**How to validate:**
1. Review all calculations
2. Test calculation methods
3. Verify rates and limits
4. Check for errors
5. Ensure consistency

## Best Practices

### For Facility Agents

**Setup process:**
1. **Configure completely**: Set up all calculations
2. **Test calculations**: Verify methods work correctly
3. **Review thoroughly**: Check all parameters
4. **Validate early**: Test as you configure
5. **Document clearly**: Keep configuration clear

**Calculation management:**
1. **Understand formulas**: Know how calculations work
2. **Set appropriate rates**: Use reasonable advance rates
3. **Define clear rules**: Make eligibility clear
4. **Test scenarios**: Verify calculations in different scenarios
5. **Monitor updates**: Track calculation changes

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard Setup

1. Configure borrowing base → Set calculation method
2. Define collateral rules → Set eligibility
3. Set advance rates → Configure rates
4. Set up facility structure → Complete configuration
5. Validate setup → Submit for approval

### Scenario 2: Complex Facility

1. Configure multiple collateral types → Set up each type
2. Set different advance rates → Per collateral type
3. Configure concentration limits → Set limits
4. Set up complex structure → Complete setup
5. Validate thoroughly → Submit

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Calculations not working"
- Check calculation method configured
- Verify formulas are correct
- Ensure all parameters set
- Test calculations
- Contact support if needed

### "Can't set advance rates"
- Check collateral types defined
- Verify rate limits appropriate
- Ensure configuration complete
- Review validation messages

## Key Takeaways

1. **Complete configuration**: Set up all calculations
2. **Validate setup**: Test calculations before submitting
3. **Clear rules**: Define eligibility clearly
4. **Appropriate rates**: Use reasonable advance rates
5. **Monitor updates**: Track calculation changes

Understanding deal setup and calculations helps facility agents effectively configure credit facilities and ensure accurate borrowing base and utilization calculations.
