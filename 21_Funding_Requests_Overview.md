# Funding Requests Overview

## Overview

A funding request is when a borrower requests to draw down funds from an active credit facility. Each request specifies the amount needed, the purpose, includes supporting documentation, and must be reviewed and approved by the facility agent before funds can be disbursed. Funding requests allow borrowers to access their approved facility limit flexibly, drawing down funds as needed rather than receiving everything upfront.

## What This Means for the User

When you have an active credit facility, you can create funding requests to access funds:

- **Request Specific Amounts**: You can request any amount up to your available borrowing capacity, not necessarily the full facility limit.

- **Specify Purpose**: Each request includes the purpose of the funds, helping facility agents and lenders understand how funds will be used.

- **Provide Documentation**: Supporting documents are required to justify the request and demonstrate compliance with facility rules.

- **Individual Review**: Each funding request is reviewed individually by facility agents to ensure compliance with facility rules and available borrowing capacity.

- **Automatic Notice Generation**: When approved, funding notices are automatically generated and sent to lenders for review and approval.

- **Multiple Requests Over Time**: You can create multiple funding requests over time as long as you stay within your facility limits and available borrowing capacity.

This structure provides flexibility while maintaining proper oversight and control.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Creating Funding Requests

To create a funding request, you:

- **Select Active Facility**: Choose the active credit facility you want to draw down from.

- **Specify Amount**: Enter the amount you want to borrow. This must be within your available borrowing capacity.

- **Enter Purpose**: Describe what the funds will be used for. This helps facility agents evaluate the request.

- **Select Funding Date**: Choose when you need the funds. This helps coordinate timing.

- **Upload Documentation**: Provide supporting documents that justify the request and demonstrate compliance.

- **Add Collateral** (if applicable): If the facility requires collateral, specify which loans or assets will be used.

- **Submit for Review**: Submit the request to facility agents for evaluation.

### Facility Agent Review

Facility agents review funding requests to:

- **Check Compliance**: Verify the request complies with all facility rules, including borrowing limits, drawdown frequency, and other requirements.

- **Verify Capacity**: Ensure sufficient borrowing capacity is available. The request amount cannot exceed available capacity.

- **Review Documentation**: Check that all required documents are provided and meet quality standards.

- **Assess Collateral** (if applicable): Verify collateral eligibility, valuation, and that it's not already pledged.

- **Make Decision**: Approve, reject, or request changes based on the evaluation.

### Approval Outcomes

When facility agents review funding requests, there are three possible outcomes:

- **Approved**: The request meets all requirements, and a funding notice is automatically generated.

- **Rejected**: The request doesn't meet requirements, and you receive a reason. You must create a new request if you want to try again.

- **Changes Requested**: The facility agent needs modifications. You can update the request and resubmit.

### Funding Notices

When funding requests are approved, funding notices are automatically generated:

- **Automatic Creation**: You don't need to create funding notices manually - they're created automatically upon approval.

- **Sent to Lenders**: Funding notices are sent to lenders for review and approval.

- **Lender Approval Required**: Each lender reviews and approves or rejects individual drawdowns.

- **Fund Transfer**: After lender approval, funds are transferred to you.

## Important Points to Know

- You can only create funding requests against active facilities - facilities must be approved by lenders and in Active status before you can request funds.

- Facility must have available borrowing capacity - you can only request amounts up to your available capacity, which may be less than your total facility limit.

- You can have only one draft request per facility at a time - you must submit or delete draft requests before creating new ones.

- Approved requests automatically generate funding notices - you don't need to create notices manually.

- Rejected requests cannot be resubmitted - if a request is rejected, you must create a new request addressing the issues.

- Change requests allow editing - if changes are requested, you can update the request and resubmit without creating a new one.

- Multiple requests over time - you can create multiple funding requests as long as you stay within limits.

- Each request is reviewed individually - facility agents evaluate each request separately, ensuring proper oversight.

- Documentation is required - supporting documents must be provided to justify requests and demonstrate compliance.

- Complete audit trail - all requests, reviews, and approvals are recorded with who did what and when.

Understanding funding requests helps you effectively request drawdowns from your credit facilities, provide proper documentation, and work within the approval process to access funds when needed.
