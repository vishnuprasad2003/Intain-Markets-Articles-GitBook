# Funding Requests Overview

## Overview

A funding request is when a borrower requests to draw down funds from an active credit facility. Each request specifies the amount needed, the purpose, and includes supporting documentation. Funding requests must be reviewed and approved by the facility agent before funds can be disbursed.

## Who Can Use This

- Borrowers who need to draw down funds from active facilities

## When This Is Used

Use funding requests when:
- You have an active credit facility
- You need to borrow funds
- You want to draw down a portion of your approved limit
- You need to request specific amounts for specific purposes

## Step-by-Step Process

### Creating a Funding Request

1. **Access Funding Requests**
   - Navigate to your active facility
   - Click "Create Funding Request"
   - Funding request form opens

2. **Enter Request Details**
   - Specify the amount you want to borrow
   - Enter the purpose of the funds
   - Select the funding date
   - Upload supporting documentation

3. **Add Collateral Information** (if applicable)

   - Provide collateral details
   - Include collateral valuation

4. **Save and Submit**
   - Save your request as draft

### Review and Approval

1. **Facility Agent Reviews**
   - Facility agent evaluates your request
   - Checks compliance with facility rules
   - Verifies borrowing capacity
   - Reviews documentation

2. **Receive Decision**

## Rules & Validations
