# Term Sheet Change Requests

## Who Can Use This

- Borrowers who receive change requests
- Facility Agents who request changes

## When This Is Used

Use change requests when:
- Facility agent needs modifications to your term sheet
- You need to update information based on feedback
- You want to improve your proposal through iteration

## Step-by-Step Process

   - Note any deadlines or priorities
   - Check if re-signing is required

## What Happens Next
