# Loan Rejection and Reinstatement

## Overview

Sometimes loans need to be removed from pools temporarily or permanently. The platform allows you to reject loans (remove them from calculations) and reinstate them (put them back) when appropriate.

## Who Can Use This

- Issuers who manage pools and loans
- Market Makers who review pools

## When This Is Used

Use loan rejection and reinstatement when:
- A loan doesn't meet pool criteria
- Data quality issues are identified
- Loans need correction before inclusion
- Pool requirements change
- You need to adjust pool composition

## Step-by-Step Process

### Rejecting a Loan

1. **Identify the Loan**
   - Navigate to the pool's loan list
   - Find the loan you want to remove
   - Review loan details

2. **Remove the Loan**
   - Select the loan to remove
   - Update loan status to "Removed"
   - Confirm the removal

3. **Review Impact**
   - Pool metrics recalculate automatically
   - Total balance decreases
   - Loan count decreases
   - Weighted averages update

### Reinstating a Loan

1. **Find Removed Loans**
   - Filter to show removed loans
   - Review why loans were removed
   - Identify loans that can be reinstated

2. **Reinstate the Loan**
   - Select the loan to reinstate
   - Update loan status to "Reinstated"
   - Confirm the reinstatement

3. **Review Impact**

## Rules & Validations

- Removed loans are excluded from pool calculations
- Removed loans remain visible in the pool
- You can reinstate removed loans if needed

- Some pool statuses may restrict removal or reinstatement

## What Happens Next

After rejecting a loan:

- Pool metrics update automatically
- Loan remains visible but marked as removed
- You can reinstate it later if needed

After reinstating a loan:
