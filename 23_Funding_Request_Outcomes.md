# Funding Request Outcomes

## Overview

When a facility agent reviews a funding request, there are three possible outcomes: Approval, Rejection, or Changes Requested. Understanding these outcomes helps borrowers know what to expect, how to proceed, and what happens next in the funding process.

## What This Means for the User

After you submit a funding request, the facility agent reviews it and makes a decision. The outcome determines:

- **What Happens Next**: Whether a funding notice is created, whether you need to create a new request, or whether you can update and resubmit.

- **Your Next Actions**: What you need to do based on the outcome (monitor notice, create new request, make changes, etc.).

- **Timeline**: How quickly you can proceed and when funds might be available.

- **Status Updates**: How the request status changes and what that means.

Understanding outcomes helps you plan your next steps and know what to expect.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Outcome 1: Approved

**What It Means**: Your funding request meets all requirements, and the facility agent has approved it.

**What Happens**:
- Funding notice is automatically created
- Request status changes to "Approved"
- Funding notice is sent to lenders for review
- You receive notification of approval

**What You Can Do**:
- Monitor funding notice progress
- Approve token transfer when ready (if required)
- Wait for lender approval
- Track status updates

**What Happens Next**:
- Lenders review the funding notice
- Lenders approve or reject the drawdown
- After lender approval, funds are transferred
- You receive the funds

**Timeline**: After approval, the process moves to lender review, which typically takes a few days depending on lender response times.

### Outcome 2: Rejected

**What It Means**: Your funding request doesn't meet requirements, and the facility agent has rejected it.

**What Happens**:
- Request status changes to "Rejected"
- Rejection reason is provided
- You receive notification of rejection
- No funding notice is created

**What You Can Do**:
- Review the rejection reason carefully
- Understand why it was rejected
- Address issues if possible
- Create a new funding request with corrections

**What Happens Next**:
- You cannot resubmit the same request
- You must create a new funding request if you want to try again
- New request should address the rejection reasons
- New request goes through the same review process

**Common Rejection Reasons**:
- Request amount exceeds available borrowing capacity
- Insufficient documentation
- Request doesn't comply with facility rules
- Collateral issues (if applicable)
- Drawdown frequency violations
- Other compliance issues

**Timeline**: You can create a new request immediately, but it will go through the full review process again.

### Outcome 3: Changes Requested

**What It Means**: The facility agent needs modifications to your request before it can be approved.

**What Happens**:
- Request status changes to "Changes Requested"
- Change request details are provided
- You receive notification of change request
- Request remains in the system for editing

**What You Can Do**:
- Review requested changes carefully
- Understand what needs to be modified
- Update the funding request
- Address all requested items
- Resubmit for review

**What Happens Next**:
- You can edit the request and make changes
- You resubmit when changes are complete
- Facility agent reviews again
- Process can repeat until approved or rejected

**Common Change Requests**:
- Additional documentation needed
- Amount adjustments
- Purpose clarification
- Collateral updates (if applicable)
- Other modifications

**Timeline**: You can make changes and resubmit quickly, and the facility agent reviews again. This is faster than creating a new request.

## Important Points to Know

- **Approved requests automatically generate funding notices** - You don't need to create notices manually. They're created automatically upon approval.

- **Rejected requests cannot be resubmitted** - If rejected, you must create a new request. The original request cannot be edited and resubmitted.

- **Change requests allow editing and resubmission** - This is less severe than rejection and allows for iterative improvement without starting over.

- **You can go through multiple rounds of changes** - The process can repeat until approved or rejected.

- **Status updates reflect the current outcome** - Request status shows the current state (Approved, Rejected, Changes Requested).

- **Notifications are sent automatically** - You receive notifications when outcomes are determined, so you don't need to check manually.

- **Rejection reasons help you improve** - Understanding why requests are rejected helps you create better requests in the future.

- **Change requests are faster than rejection** - If changes are requested, you can update and resubmit quickly without creating a new request.

- **Lender approval is still required after facility agent approval** - Even if the facility agent approves, lenders must still approve funding notices before funds are disbursed.

- **Complete audit trail** - All outcomes, reasons, and actions are recorded with who did what and when.

Understanding funding request outcomes helps you know what to expect, how to proceed based on the outcome, and how to improve your requests for better results in the future.
