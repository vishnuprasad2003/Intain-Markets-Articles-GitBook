2. Lender transfers funds → Actual transfer
3. Lender confirms transfer → Status: transferred
4. Lender's participation complete → Drawdown done

1. Lender A approves and transfers → Confirms → Complete
2. Lender B approves and transfers → Confirms → Complete
3. Lender C approves and transfers → Confirms → Complete
