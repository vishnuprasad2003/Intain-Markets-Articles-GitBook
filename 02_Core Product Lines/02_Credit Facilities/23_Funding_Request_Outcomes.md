# Funding Request Outcomes

## Overview

When a facility agent reviews a funding request, there are three possible outcomes: Approval, Rejection, or Changes Requested. Understanding these outcomes helps borrowers know what to expect and how to proceed.

## Outcome 1: Approved

### Next Steps for Borrower
