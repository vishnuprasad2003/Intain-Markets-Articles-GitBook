# Funding Notice Review

## Overview

Funding notice review is the process where lenders review funding notices after borrower token approval and decide whether to approve or reject individual drawdowns. This guide covers how lenders evaluate funding notices, assess drawdown requests, and make independent approval decisions for each drawdown.

## Who Can Use This

### Making Approval Decisions

   - Confirm approval
   - Your participation is confirmed
   - You can proceed with fund transfer
   - Your portion of the drawdown is committed

2. **Reject Drawdown**
   - Review and identify concerns or issues
   - Determine drawdown doesn't meet your criteria

   - Provide rejection reason if required
   - Enter comments explaining rejection
   - Confirm rejection

   - Other lenders make independent decisions

## Rules & Validations

- Each lender makes independent decision - your decision doesn't affect other lenders' choices.

- Your decision doesn't affect other lenders - other lenders can approve or reject independently.

- You can approve or reject based on your evaluation - make decisions based on your own criteria and risk tolerance.

- Approved lenders can proceed with fund transfer - if you approve, you can transfer your allocated portion.

- Rejected lenders don't participate in that drawdown - if you reject, you won't fund your portion, but other lenders can still participate.

- Decisions are final once submitted - you cannot easily change your decision after submitting.

- Rejection reasons help borrowers understand - providing reasons helps borrowers understand lender concerns.

- Individual tracking - each lender's decision is tracked separately with timestamps and details.

- Borrower visibility - borrowers can see which lenders approved and which rejected.

- Complete audit trail - all decisions are recorded with who made what decision and when.

## What Happens Next

After making your decision:
- **If Approved**: You can proceed with fund transfer, transfer your allocated portion to the borrower, confirm the transfer, and your participation is complete.

- **If Rejected**: You don't participate in this drawdown, other lenders make their own decisions independently, borrower can see your rejection, and you can participate in future drawdowns.

After all lenders decide:
- Approved lenders transfer funds and confirm transfers
- Borrower receives funds from approved lenders
- Drawdown process completes as transfers are confirmed
- Borrower can track which lenders participated
- Complete documentation is maintained

Understanding funding notice review helps lenders make informed decisions on drawdowns, participate effectively in credit facilities, manage their participation based on their own evaluation criteria, and work within the flexible drawdown structure that allows individual lender decisions.
