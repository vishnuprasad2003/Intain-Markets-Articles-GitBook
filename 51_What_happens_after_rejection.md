# What Happens After Rejection

## Overview

When an item is rejected, it enters a final state with specific consequences. Understanding what happens after rejection helps you know what to expect, why you can't edit rejected items, and how to proceed when your submissions are rejected.

## What This Means for the User

When your submission is rejected:

- **Final State**: The item enters a final state and cannot proceed further in the workflow.

- **Cannot Edit**: Rejected items become read-only and cannot be edited or modified.

- **Cannot Resubmit**: You cannot resubmit the same rejected item - you must create a new one.

- **Rejection Reason Provided**: You receive a reason explaining why it was rejected, helping you understand what to fix.

- **Learn and Improve**: Rejections provide learning opportunities - you can address issues and create better submissions.

- **Start Fresh**: You create new items to try again, incorporating lessons learned from rejection.

Understanding rejection outcomes helps you know how to proceed and improve future submissions.
