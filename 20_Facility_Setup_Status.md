# Facility Setup Status

## Overview

The facility setup status tracks whether a master commitment has been fully configured and is ready for lender approval. This status helps facility agents know what still needs to be completed before submitting the facility.

## Who Can Use This

## When This Is Used

Use facility setup status when:
