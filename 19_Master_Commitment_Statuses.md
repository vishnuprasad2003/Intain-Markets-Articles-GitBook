# Master Commitment Statuses

## Overview

Master commitments progress through three main statuses from creation to activation. Understanding these statuses helps you know where your facility is in the setup process, what actions are available, and what needs to happen next.

## Reference Details

### Draft Status

**What It Means**: The master commitment has been automatically created from your approved term sheet, and the facility agent is configuring it. All fields can be edited, and the facility is not yet submitted for lender approval.

**What Facility Agents Can Do**:
- Configure facility rules and parameters
- Set up borrowing base calculations
- Define collateral eligibility rules
- Add and configure lender groups
- Edit all fields and settings
- Save changes multiple times

**What Borrowers Can Do**:
- View the master commitment (read-only)
- Monitor configuration progress
- See what's being set up

**What Lenders Can Do**:
- Cannot see the master commitment yet (not submitted for approval)

**Who Can See It**: Facility agents (who configure it) and borrowers (who can view it).

**Typical Duration**: This status lasts until the facility agent completes configuration and submits for lender approval.

**What Happens Next**: Facility agent completes configuration and submits for lender approval, moving to Pending Lender Approval status.

### Pending Lender Approval Status

**What It Means**: The facility agent has completed configuration and submitted the master commitment for lender approval. The facility is waiting for at least one lender to approve it.

**What Facility Agents Can Do**:
- View the master commitment
- Monitor approval status
- Cannot edit (configuration is complete)

**What Borrowers Can Do**:
- View the master commitment (read-only)
- Monitor approval progress
- See which lenders are reviewing
- Cannot create funding requests yet (facility not active)

**What Lenders Can Do**:
- Review the complete master commitment
- See facility rules, borrowing base calculations, lender groups, and all configurations
- Approve the facility via electronic signature
- Reject the facility (if allowed)

**Who Can See It**: Facility agents, borrowers, and lenders who are configured in the facility.

**Typical Duration**: This status lasts until at least one lender approves the facility.

**What Happens Next**: 
- **If Approved**: Facility moves to Active status, and borrowers can create funding requests.
- **If Rejected**: Facility may return to Draft status for reconfiguration, or process may stop.

**Important Note**: Any lender approval activates the facility. You don't need all lenders to approve before the facility becomes active.

### Active Status

**What It Means**: At least one lender has approved the master commitment, and the facility is operational. Borrowers can create funding requests, and the facility is fully functional.

**What Facility Agents Can Do**:
- View the active facility
- Review funding requests
- Manage facility operations
- Monitor borrowing activity
- Cannot edit master commitment (facility is active)

**What Borrowers Can Do**:
- View the active facility
- Create funding requests
- Monitor borrowing capacity
- Track drawdowns
- View facility rules and parameters

**What Lenders Can Do**:
- View the active facility
- Review and approve funding notices
- Monitor facility activity
- Track borrowing and repayments

**Who Can See It**: All parties involved in the facility (facility agents, borrowers, and lenders).

**Typical Duration**: This is the operational status. The facility remains active until it expires, is closed, or is terminated.

**What Happens Next**: Borrowers create funding requests, facility agents review them, funding notices are generated, lenders approve drawdowns, and funds are disbursed.

**Important Note**: Once active, master commitments typically cannot be edited. All facility rules and configurations are locked in.

## Important Notes

- **Status Progression**: Master commitments progress from Draft → Pending Lender Approval → Active. You cannot skip stages or go backwards easily.

- **Status Changes Are Recorded**: Every status change is recorded with who changed it and when, creating a complete audit trail.

- **Status Controls Actions**: The current status determines what actions are available. For example, borrowers can only create funding requests when the facility is Active.

- **Any Lender Approval Activates**: You don't need all lenders to approve before the facility becomes active. Any single lender approval is sufficient.

- **Cannot Edit After Active**: Once a facility is Active, the master commitment typically cannot be edited. Make sure configuration is correct before submission.

- **Status Badges**: Statuses are displayed as badges or labels, often color-coded (green for active, yellow for pending, etc.).

- **Configuration Must Be Complete**: Facility agents must complete all required configuration before submitting for lender approval.

- **Electronic Signature Required**: Lender approval requires electronic signature, making it legally binding.

- **Status History**: You can view the complete history of status changes, including who changed them and when, by viewing the master commitment's audit trail or history.

- **Borrowers Cannot Create Requests Until Active**: Funding requests can only be created when the facility is in Active status.

Understanding master commitment statuses helps you track facility setup progress, know what actions are available at each stage, understand why certain actions are disabled, and know when facilities become active and operational.
