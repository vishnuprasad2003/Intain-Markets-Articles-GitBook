# Master Commitment Statuses

## Overview

Master commitments progress through three main statuses from creation to activation. Understanding these statuses helps you know where your facility is in the setup process and what actions are available.

## Who Can Use This

- Facility Agents who configure master commitments
- Borrowers who monitor facility setup
- Lenders who approve facilities

## When This Is Used

Understanding master commitment statuses helps when:
- You need to track facility setup progress
- You want to know what actions are available
- You need to understand why certain actions are disabled
- You want to know when facilities become active

## Step-by-Step Process

### Status Flow

1. **Draft Status**
   - Master commitment is automatically created
   - Facility agent can configure it
   - All fields can be edited
   - Not yet submitted for approval

2. **Pending Lender Approval Status**
   - Facility agent has completed configuration
   - Submitted for lender approval
   - Waiting for lender decision
   - Any lender can approve

3. **Active Status**
   - Facility is operational
   - Approved by at least one lender
   - Borrowers can create funding requests
   - Facility is fully functional

## Rules & Validations

- You can only edit master commitments while they're in Draft status
- You must complete all required fields before submission
- Any lender approval activates the facility
- Once active, facilities cannot be edited
- Active facilities allow funding requests

## What Happens Next

After understanding master commitment statuses:
- You know what actions are available at each status
- You can track facility setup progress
- You understand why certain actions are disabled
- You know when facilities become active
- You can plan your workflow accordingly

Understanding master commitment statuses helps you track facility setup progress and know what actions are available at each stage.
