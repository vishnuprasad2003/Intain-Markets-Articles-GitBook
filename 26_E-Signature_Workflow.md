# E-Signature Workflow

## Overview

E-signatures are used throughout the credit facility workflow to digitally sign important documents. The platform supports electronic signatures, enabling a complete digital workflow without paper documents. Electronic signatures are legally binding and provide complete traceability of who signed what and when.

## Who Can Use This

- Borrowers who sign term sheets and approve token transfers
- Facility Agents who sign funding notices on behalf of lenders
- Lenders who sign master commitments to approve facilities

## When This Is Used

Use e-signatures when:
- You need to sign term sheets as a borrower
- You need to sign master commitments as a lender
- Facility agents need to sign funding notices for lenders
- You want to complete documents digitally
- You need legally binding signatures for documents

## Step-by-Step Process

### Signing Term Sheets (Borrowers)

1. **Access Term Sheet for Signing**
   - Navigate to your term sheet
   - Ensure term sheet is complete and ready for signing
   - Click to initiate electronic signature process
   - Electronic signature interface opens

2. **Review Document**
   - Review the complete term sheet document
   - Verify all terms and conditions are correct
   - Check that all information is accurate
   - Ensure you understand what you're signing

3. **Complete Electronic Signature**
   - Follow the signature interface instructions
   - Apply your electronic signature
   - Complete all required signature fields
   - Confirm your signature

4. **Verify Signature Completion**
   - Confirm signature is complete
   - Review the signed version
   - Verify signature is recorded
   - Status updates to show term sheet is signed

5. **Submit for Review**
   - After signing, term sheet is ready for submission
   - Submit to facility agent for review
   - Status shows as "BorrowerSigned" or similar

### Signing Master Commitments (Lenders)

1. **Review Master Commitment**
   - Navigate to master commitments pending your approval
   - Review the complete facility structure
   - Evaluate facility terms, rules, and parameters
   - Assess borrowing base calculations and lender groups
   - Decide whether to approve the facility

2. **Initiate Electronic Signature**
   - If you decide to approve, click to sign
   - Electronic signature interface opens
   - Review the master commitment document
   - Verify all facility details are correct

3. **Complete Signature and Approval**
   - Apply your electronic signature
   - Complete all required signature fields
   - Confirm your approval
   - Signature is recorded with timestamp

4. **Facility Activation**
   - When you sign, facility becomes active (if first lender approval)
   - Status updates to "Active"
   - Borrowers can now create funding requests
   - You receive confirmation of approval

### Signing Funding Notices (Facility Agents)

1. **Generate Tokens First**
   - Ensure tokens have been generated for the funding notice
   - Verify token distribution is configured
   - Confirm all lender allocations are correct

2. **Sign for Each Lender**
   - Facility agent signs funding notice for each lender individually
   - Each lender's signature is tracked separately
   - Sign for Lender 1, then Lender 2, and so on
   - Each signature is recorded independently

3. **Complete All Signatures**
   - Sign for all lenders in the facility
   - Verify all signatures are complete
   - Each lender's signature status is tracked
   - Status shows signatures are completed

4. **Enable Borrower Approval**
   - After facility agent signs, borrower can approve token transfer
   - Funding notice becomes visible to lenders
   - Lenders can review and approve drawdowns

## Rules & Validations

- Electronic signatures are legally binding - once signed, documents are legally valid and enforceable.

- You must sign before documents can proceed - unsigned documents cannot move to next stages in the workflow.

- Some documents require multiple signatures - term sheets need borrower signature, master commitments need lender signatures, funding notices need facility agent signatures.

- Signatures are tracked with timestamps - every signature is recorded with who signed and when, creating a complete audit trail.

- Signed documents are stored securely - all signed documents are stored securely and can be retrieved for audit purposes.

- Re-signing may be required - if documents are modified significantly, you may need to sign again.

- Signature status is visible - you can see signature status and completion for all parties.

- Cannot undo signatures easily - once signed, signatures are permanent and cannot be easily reversed.

- Status updates after signing - document status updates to reflect signature completion.

- Complete traceability - all signatures are tracked with complete details for audit and compliance.

## What Happens Next

After signing term sheets:
- Term sheet status updates to show it's signed
- You can submit term sheet for facility agent review
- Facility agent reviews and makes decision (approve, reject, or request changes)
- If approved, master commitment is automatically created

After signing master commitments:
- Facility becomes active (if first lender approval)
- Status updates to "Active"
- Borrowers can create funding requests
- Facility is operational and ready for drawdowns

After signing funding notices:
- Borrower can approve token transfer
- Funding notice becomes visible to lenders
- Lenders can review and approve drawdowns
- Fund transfer process can proceed

Understanding e-signature workflow helps you complete documents digitally, move through the credit facility process efficiently, and ensure all required signatures are obtained for legal validity and compliance.
