# Feedback vs Rejection

## Overview

Understanding the difference between feedback (change requests) and rejection helps you know how to respond and what to expect. Both are part of the review process but have different implications for your workflow and how you proceed.

## What This Means for the User

When reviewers provide input, there are two types:

- **Change Requests (Feedback)**: Less severe - reviewers want modifications but the item can be improved and resubmitted. This is an iterative improvement process.

- **Rejection**: More severe - reviewers have decided the item cannot proceed, and you must create a new item to try again.

Understanding the difference helps you respond appropriately and know what to expect.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Change Requests (Feedback)

**What They Are**:
- Requests for modifications to improve the item
- Issues can be fixed through editing
- Iterative improvement process
- Not a final state - item can proceed after changes
- Opportunity to refine and improve

**What Happens**:
- Status changes to show changes are requested (e.g., "CHANGES_REQUESTED")
- Item becomes editable again
- You can make modifications
- You can save multiple times while working
- You can resubmit when changes are complete

**How to Respond**:
- Read change request carefully
- Understand what specific modifications are needed
- Make all requested changes thoroughly
- Address all requested items
- Review your changes before resubmitting
- Resubmit when complete

**Outcome**:
- Item can be improved and resubmitted
- Process can continue after changes
- Iterative improvement is possible
- Multiple rounds of changes are allowed
- Item can eventually be approved

### Rejection

**What It Is**:
- Final decision that item will not proceed
- Item cannot be fixed through editing
- Final state - process stops here
- Must create new item to try again
- More severe than change requests

**What Happens**:
- Status changes to "Rejected" or "REJECTED"
- Item becomes read-only
- Cannot be edited
- Cannot be resubmitted
- Process stops for this item

**How to Respond**:
- Review rejection reason carefully
- Understand why item was rejected
- Learn from rejection feedback
- Create completely new item
- Address issues identified in rejection
- Try again with improvements

**Outcome**:
- Item cannot proceed
- Must create new item to try again
- New item goes through full review process
- Can try again with improvements
- Process starts over with new item

## Important Points to Know

- **Change requests allow you to edit and resubmit** - This is less severe and allows iterative improvement without starting over.

- **Rejections are final and cannot be resubmitted** - Rejected items are final, and you must create new items.

- **You can go through multiple rounds of changes** - Change requests allow iterative improvement until approved or rejected.

- **Rejected items must be replaced with new items** - You cannot resubmit rejected items - new items are required.

- **Both help improve quality** - Both change requests and rejections help improve quality, but through different approaches.

- **Change requests are faster** - You can update and resubmit quickly without creating new items.

- **Rejections require starting over** - You must create new items, which takes more time.

- **Rejection reasons are important** - Pay attention to reasons to understand what needs to be fixed in new items.

- **Change request details guide improvements** - Specific change requests tell you exactly what to modify.

- **Both provide learning opportunities** - Both help you understand requirements and improve future submissions.

Understanding feedback vs rejection helps you know how to respond to change requests, understand what to do after rejection, improve items through iterative changes, know when to create new items, and navigate review processes effectively to achieve approval.
