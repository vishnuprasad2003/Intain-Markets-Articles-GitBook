# Feedback vs Rejection

## Overview

Understanding the difference between feedback (change requests) and rejection helps you know how to respond and what to expect. Both are part of the review process but have different implications.

## Who Can Use This

- Borrowers who receive change requests or rejections
- Issuers who receive feedback or rejections
- All users who want to understand review outcomes

## When This Is Used

Understanding feedback vs rejection helps when:
- You receive a change request
- Your submission is rejected
- You want to know how to respond
- You need to understand the difference

## Step-by-Step Process

### Change Requests (Feedback)

1. **What They Are**
   - Request for modifications
   - Issues can be fixed
   - Iterative improvement process
   - Not a final state
   - Opportunity to improve

2. **What Happens**
   - Status changes to show changes requested
   - Item becomes editable again
   - You can make modifications
   - You can save multiple times
   - You can resubmit when ready

3. **How to Respond**
   - Read change request carefully
   - Understand what needs to change
   - Make all requested modifications
   - Address all items thoroughly
   - Resubmit when complete

### Rejection

1. **What It Is**
   - Final decision
   - Item will not proceed
   - Cannot be fixed
   - Final state
   - Must create new item

2. **What Happens**
   - Status changes to rejected
   - Item becomes read-only
   - Cannot be edited
   - Cannot be resubmitted
   - Process stops here

3. **How to Respond**
   - Review rejection reason
   - Understand why rejected
   - Create new item
   - Address issues identified
   - Try again with improvements

## Rules & Validations

- Change requests allow you to edit and resubmit
