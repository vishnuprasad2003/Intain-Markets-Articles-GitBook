# Pools Overview

## Overview

A pool is a collection of loans grouped together for securitization, whole loan sales, or other structured finance transactions. Pools help you organize loans, present them to investors, and manage the entire transaction process.

## Who Can Use This

- Issuers who create and manage pools
- Market Makers who review and structure pools
- Investors who review investment opportunities
- Other parties involved in pool transactions

## When This Is Used

Use pools when you:
- Want to group multiple loans together for a transaction
- Need to present loans to potential investors or lenders
- Want to calculate aggregate statistics across multiple loans
- Need to manage a structured finance transaction from start to finish

## Step-by-Step Process

### Creating a Pool

1. **Provide Basic Information**
   - Enter a unique pool name
   - Select the asset class (type of loans)
   - Choose the transaction type
   - Add a description if needed
   - Indicate if this is a closing deal

2. **Assign Organizations**
   - Select market makers, investors, servicers, and other parties
   - Assign organizations that will be involved in the transaction

3. **Map Loans to the Pool**
   - Select loans to include in the pool
   - Map loans to the pool
   - Review pool metrics that calculate automatically

4. **Review Pool Metrics**
   - Check total balance and loan count
   - Review weighted average coupon, FICO scores, and other metrics
   - Ensure metrics meet your requirements

### Managing a Pool

1. **Share the Pool**
   - Share with market makers for structuring
   - Share with investors for investment opportunities
   - Set permissions for what recipients can do

2. **Track Pool Status**
   - Monitor status changes from Created to Preview to Deal
   - Respond to feedback and change requests
   - Work with market makers on structuring

3. **Complete the Transaction**
   - Finalize the pool as a deal
   - Complete the structured finance transaction
   - Manage ongoing servicing if applicable

## Rules & Validations

- Pool names must be unique
- Loans can only belong to one pool at a time
- Pool metrics calculate automatically from mapped loans
- You can edit pools while they're in Created or Preview status
- Once a pool becomes a Deal, editing is restricted
- Removed loans are excluded from pool calculations

## What Happens Next

After creating a pool:
- You can map loans and see metrics update automatically
- You can share the pool with other parties for review
- Market makers can accept mandates to structure the deal
- Investors can review and express interest
- The pool progresses through statuses until finalized as a deal

Pools provide the foundation for structured finance transactions, allowing you to organize loans, present them effectively, and manage the entire process through completion.
