# Role-Based Pool Views

## Overview

Different users see pools differently based on their role. The platform automatically filters information and shows you only relevant items and appropriate actions for your role, making navigation simpler and more focused. Understanding role-based views helps you know what pools you can see, what actions are available, and why some pools aren't visible to you.

## What This Means for the User

When you log in with a specific role, the platform automatically shows you:

- Only pools where you have a role or where pools are shared with you
- Only actions that are appropriate for your role
- Only information relevant to your responsibilities
- A dashboard tailored to your role

This filtering happens automatically - you don't need to search through irrelevant information or wonder why you can't see certain pools. The platform presents you with exactly what you need for your role.

## Important Points to Know

- **Visibility Based on Role**: You only see pools where you have a role or where pools are shared with you. If you can't see a pool, it's likely not shared with you or you don't have a role in it.

- **Status Affects Visibility**: Some statuses restrict visibility. For example, pools in Created status are only visible to the issuer who created them until they're shared.

- **Sharing Controls Visibility**: When issuers share pools, they control who can see them. You'll only see pools shared with your organization.

- **Role Determines Actions**: Your role determines what actions are available. Even if you can see a pool, you may not be able to take certain actions if they're not appropriate for your role.

- **Multiple Roles**: If you have multiple roles, you can log in with different roles at different times to see different views. Each role shows you a different set of pools and actions.

- **Dashboard Tailored to Role**: Your dashboard shows items relevant to your role - pending actions, recent activity, and items requiring your attention.

- **Filtering Is Automatic**: The platform filters information automatically - you don't need to manually filter or search through irrelevant items.

- **Action Buttons Are Role-Aware**: Action buttons are enabled or disabled based on your role and the pool's status. You'll only see actions you can actually take.

- **Collaboration Through Sharing**: Different roles collaborate through sharing - issuers share with market makers and investors, who then see the pools in their views.

Understanding role-based views helps you navigate the platform effectively, know what pools you can see and why, understand what actions are available to your role, and work efficiently within your responsibilities.
