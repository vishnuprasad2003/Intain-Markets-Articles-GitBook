# Role-Based Pool Views

## Overview

Different users see pools differently based on their role. The platform automatically shows you only relevant information and actions for your role, making navigation simpler and more focused.

## Who Can Use This

- Issuers who create pools
- Market Makers who review pools
- Investors who review opportunities
- Servicers and Paying Agents
- Rating Agencies

## When This Is Used

Understanding role-based views helps when:
- You want to know what pools you can see
- You need to understand what actions are available to you
- You want to know why you can't see certain pools
- You need to understand what other roles see

## Step-by-Step Process

### Understanding Your View

1. **Check Your Role**
   - Your role is shown in the top navigation
   - It determines what you see and can do
   - Each role has a different view

2. **View Your Pools**
   - Issuers see pools they created
   - Market Makers see pools shared with them or assigned for mandate
   - Investors see pools shared for investment opportunities
   - Servicers see pools they're assigned to service

3. **Use Role-Specific Actions**
   - Issuers can create, edit, and share pools
   - Market Makers can review, accept mandates, and provide feedback
   - Investors can review opportunities and express interest
   - Each role has appropriate actions available

### Visibility Rules

1. **Created Status**
   - Visible only to the issuer who created it
   - Not shared with other parties yet

2. **Preview Status**
   - Visible to issuer and organizations it's shared with
   - Market makers, investors, and rating agencies can see shared pools
   - Sharing permissions control what recipients can do

3. **Mandate Pending Status**
   - Visible to issuer and assigned market maker
   - Market maker is reviewing the mandate

4. **Deal Status**
   - Visible to all relevant parties
   - Issuer, market maker, investors, servicers, and paying agents can see it
   - Based on organization assignments

## Rules & Validations

- You only see pools where you have a role or where pools are shared with you
- Your role determines what actions are available
- Status affects visibility - some statuses restrict who can see pools
- Sharing permissions control what recipients can do with shared pools
- You cannot see pools you're not involved with

## What Happens Next

After understanding role-based views:
- You know what pools you can see and why
- You understand what actions are available to your role
- You know why some pools aren't visible to you
- You can work effectively within your role's view
- You understand how collaboration works between roles

The platform automatically filters information based on your role, showing you only what's relevant and making it easier to focus on your responsibilities.
